Showerthoughts,"The above is the content of this morning's actual shower thought, but recomposed for clarity and comprehensiveness.

Below is the series of thoughts which explain and explore it.

* The strongest instinctive drives humans experience are the survival instinct of the individual, the instinct to copulate, and instinct to protect and nurture our children. The latter two together compose the instinctive drive for the survival of the species.

* All other ""instincts"" serve either the drive for personal survival, or the drive for species survival.

* Procreation is the natural result of the copulation instinct, not the drive itself.

* A way these instincts can be said to manifest is the craving for connection; with the universe, with others, with something. This instinctive craving is often characterized as spirituality.

* Spirituality is publicly and easily accessible through the practice of ritual, which often develops into tradition, but the act of consensual sex is the ultimate achievement of this desired connection.

* Masturbation, when done as part of an expression of fantasy involving connection with another being, is a highly effective way of satisfying the craving, though to a lesser extent than through actual physical congress with another. 

* Masturbation then is a way of supplanting the drive to copulate, making it a very useful means of harmlessly satisfying this strong drive for those unable to establish intimate connections with others, or for shorter term diversion between periods of satisfying interpersonal intimacy.

* Genital mutilation (GM) is a direct means of hampering the ability of an individual to effectively satisfy the craving for connection in the absence of another person. What remains is the more abstract spirituality of connection achievable through ritual.

* An alternate way of experiencing connection with others is through the attainment and exercise of power over others. This is inherently a weaker connection to the extent that it is not consensual.

* Both because it is not consensual and because it is not solitary, this form of satisfying the drive for connection falls into a middle ground between ritual exercise and interpersonal intimacy. This makes it much more effective at meeting the instinctive need for those capable of achieving it.

* The nonconsensual nature of the power connection makes it a highly attractive course to pursue for those who disdain either solitary approach, the ritual or the masturbatory.

* As a side note, sharing the practices of either ritual or masturbation with others is a way of heightening the sense of connection, which explains the attractiveness of both spiritual congregation and mutual masturbation. However, being accessible without the personal risk associated with intimacy (or with the practice of sexual hedonism in an intolerant culture), spiritual congregation is generally more accessible and publicly acceptable.","Individual spirituality, masturbation, spiritual gatherings, circle jerking, exercising power over others, and consensual sexual intimacy are all points, in order of their potential to satisfy the drive, along a spectrum of expressions of the basic human instinct for survival of the species."
