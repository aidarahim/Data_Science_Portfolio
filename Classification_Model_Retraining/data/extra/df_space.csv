space,"So, I'm sure this mehtod isn't new in any way, but I was thinking about the universe ([like you do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ7EPd9MVS0)) and I came up with a way for me to conceptualize the extremely large masses stated for objects in the universe. 

Large objects are usually weighed in solar masses. (Remember, the Sun makes up [99.8%](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/) of the mass of our entire solar system, Jupiter is about .15%, and the rest of the planets, moons, asteroids, dust ect. make up the other .05%)


The black hole at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy, [Sagittarius A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*), weighs in at 2.6 million solar masses. That‚Äôs big. Too big, really for us humans to fully comprehend. So I did some math: if you think of the Sun‚Äôs mass as one second, earth is Earth is 3 micro seconds, and Sagittarius A* would be 30 days, 2 hours.


The quasar [TON 618](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TON_618) is one of the brightest objects in the known Universe, so bright that the galaxy spinning around it is not visible from Earth, because the quasar itself outshines it. The ultramassive black hole at the center of TON 618 is the largest currently know, it is estimated to weigh 66 billion solar masses. That‚Äôs 2,097 years, 175 days if our Sun is 1 second.","I thought of a way to conceptualize extremely large numbers for myself, I though you all would enjoy"

space,"So I recently had the privilege of viewing a cloudless super moon, aka full moon in my area, and it was so dazzlingly bright that I could see my own natural shadow quite clearly in the middle of the night. More importantly, I got the clearest but also most blinding view of the moon that I have seen in years. It was so bright that the reflected lunar light left imprints in my retinas akin to staring naked at the sun!

While watching the moon, I noticed how sad he looked up there all alone, it really is kind of odd how human the moon\`s \`face\` so to speak looks when it is in its full brightened glory. The moon's features are so defined that just staring at it with your eyes is provocative enough. That night, I came up with an idea: how might the Man in the Moon\`s facial structure would look like if it was a human face? I decided to look it up on the internet, but couldn't find a single artistic rendering of a human [Man on the Moon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_in_the_Moon), so now I come here to ask Reddit to help realize this dream with me.

Here\`s an interesting challenge for any digital artists who might be reading this post. I want you to try to create a digital design of the facial features of the [Man in the Moon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_in_the_Moon) on a human face in all its glory.

Now before you go crazy with your image, here are some things that you should keep in mind. The geological processes that created the ominous Man in the Moon were not perfect, and the asymmetrical landscape around his eyes, nose and mouth makes it look like he is aged significantly. He also seems to carry an apparent sadness that comes with an elder's tired wisdom plastered on his face. But, realize that just because he looks like an old man, it doesn't mean you should just stick a crazy old man's full beard on your replica since there is no mountain large enough on the night sky full moon that makes it look like he has a full beard.  
Although its entirely up to the artist to fashion their moon man however they want him to look for the specificity of their artistic idea of the Man on the Moon, the challenge here is to attempt to create the best, most identical and realistic human Man on the Moon face. Whether the artist wants to attempt to make him look like a young man, emo kid or old wise man with a beard, clean or rough is entire up to them, but that is not the ultimate goal of this challenge.

If you are going to attempt to create a perfect human copy of the Man in the Moon's face, it would be best to keep in mind exactly how his face looks like as he treads alone across the night sky. Facial features, short or no hair, lack of beard, cheeks &amp; mouth, and an almost tired, sad facial expression. Try to keep resemblance of the moon's imaginary face.

Thanks for reading! Here's to hoping that someone will actually attempt this challenge, as I could not find a single image on the internet of the Man in the Moon as a human being. Please share to any digital artists you may know, and good luck artists, share your work!

It seems like a reasonable thing for us to melt and look at some samples of the water ice on mars.

However, some data was still sent to Earth with the understanding that it may be wrong data, or just gibberish.

With a Mars colony in our not distant future (fingers crossed) a 10 day period with lack of communication to Earth could become a problem if the colony needs help solving a problem (medical, mechanical. Something that isn't urgent in the sense of minutes but in the sense of hours). 
To solve this a relay satellite could be used to go around the sun, but in order to avoid extra expenses is there a way that a more powerful signal could be sent? Maybe the same signal could be sent 20-50 times and more or less assembled to create a coherent message?

I want to try create an astronomy community where I live. I would use the telescope on viewing nights to bring wonder to peoples eyes The picture in the campaign is one I personally took during Lunar Observation. In November I am taking a trip to Nevada to take breathtaking images of Celestial Objects, the telescope I have right now would not allow me to take the full benefit of this amazing opportunity. I also want to start a community of amateurs astronomers where I live. Due to this I decided that I would open a Go Fund me page to allow to to purchase the new telescope of significantly larger aperture and expensive filters such has Oxygen 3 filters and Hydrogen Alpha filters. I want to be able to use this ability to inspire the community and bring attention to a world filled with beauty which exists above us that only a mere amount of people have been able to witness. The one thing that bring the most satisfaction to my life is when someone I know whether it be a friend or family member or neighbor looks through my telescope for the first time and looks through it with Awe as if they have discovered a whole new world.

&amp;#x200B;

So the story is kind of like The Martian, but instead of being on Mars, it's about a russian guy who crashes on the moon during a russian secret moon landing. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I'd lik to know is 

1. Can space suit, especially an old one such as the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krechet-94](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krechet-94) be rechared outside a spacecraft? Common sense says no haha, but I'm still asking. Basically I need to know if he can resupply his suits consumables using some oxygen tanks that he finds in the crash area. If not, I'll need to modify the story (and I think that's very likely).
2. is there any way to find out your location? I'm thinking either navigation via maps or via stars. But the first option is not really useful, since Apollo astronauts on the moon even missed a crater (despite having maps) due to how difficult orientation is on the lunar landscape. The idea is the cosmonaut doesn't know where he crashed, and he needs to make his way to a rover or to the site where another LK (russian luna lander) is. So is there a realistic way for him to orientate on the moon, with the help of wither maps or stars?

space,"A basic explanation of the accepted concept of the Relativity of Similarity if required is in this 'bread slices of time' video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrqmMoI0wks. There is a very interesting discussion in comments which talks about what we perceive as choice as being an illusion. Such a notion certainly fits with the concept.

The reason for making this post is to I guess question the logic behind this view. The basis for the view seems to rest on there being a somewhat finite and number of 'time slices' that can be made, and that all slices are arbitrarily made to account for everything happening at that moment. What if that everything is not what we assume it is?

What I propose is that the amount of time slices is largely infinite, accounting for what is typically understood as higher dimensions. Even the explanation of the Relativity of Simultaneity already alludes to higher dimensions, they just seem to largely be forgotten when using it as a basis for determining that freedom of choice is an illusion. 

From my understanding higher dimensions contain infinite possibilities, as in everything that has happened, will happen and could happen at any time anywhere. Already this infinite amount of possible 'time slices' allows for an ""infinite"" amount of freedom of choice i.e. you are not always destined to be run over by a bus in 2035, or meet the same people for example.

I believe the analogy of using a loaf of bread to explain 'time slices'  is what has given rise to the idea of time and possible outcomes being destined to happen as to us bread is only able to be cut so many times.

What do you think? Would you agree that the amount of 'time slices' are infinite? That there are so many slices that one slice can actually be another while still obeying the proven equation of speed = time/distance ?",The Relativity of Simultaneity: Illusion of Choice vs Higher Dimensions

The next full moon on a Friday the 13th isn‚Äôt expected to happen again for another 30 years.¬†¬†

The moon turns full today in much of the western hemisphere, only about 1% of full moons fall on a Friday the 13th. This one is even rarer occurring near apogee, the furthest point in the Moon's orbit. This last happened in 1832 and won't happen again for more than 500 years.¬†¬†

I guess I'm asking. Does the curvature of gravity from a star rebound and oscillate up and down after a star explodes given a black hole doesn't form. 

If it does oscillate would the brain experience some weird warped time travel reality in a ship that rides the time variable as it balances back out? If it oscillates up and down alot would he essentially go back in time and forward in time quickly for a second or two?

space," There are a lot of celestial bodies that have disk-shaped structures. Most galaxies are disk-shaped, solar system is disk-shaped, and accretion disks around black holes are all flat. 

 Obviously, a black hole's gravity doesn't affect only horizontal directions. IT affects everything around from all directions because black holes are spherical. If so, substances around a black hole must cover the black hole because they are pulled from all directions. I guess the accretion disks should be spherical because black holes are spherical. However, why is an accretion disk flat? 

My question is, why does every substance rotate around the black hole in 'one direction' and forms a flat disk even though substances are pulled from all directions?",Why is an accretion disk flat?

space," Elon tweeted SpaceX intends to use the dual bell nozzle on the vacuum engines on Starship:

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1171125683327651840?s=21

 This is a good start. Frankly, this is FAR overdue. This is a type of altitude compensating nozzle. Altitude compensating nozzles are known to be able to increase payload and some types such as the aerospike have been known about since the 60‚Äôs from the earliest times of orbital spaceflight.

 However, the dual bell is not the most efficient method of altitude compensation. Other methods are known to able to give sea level engines the full vacuum Isp of vacuum-optimized upper stage engines. Moreover these methods reduce the gravity loss because they also increase the sea level, liftoff thrust.

 A problem though is the aerospike requires an expensive and time-consuming redesign of an engine, changing the usual cylindrical combustion chamber to a toroidal one. But the point of the matter is there are relatively inexpensive attachments to an existing engine that can be made to give them that optimized altitude compensation ability. One is the expandable nozzle investigated though not implemented during the Apollo era:

space,"Ok I was a bit hazed and sleep deprived,but for some reason thoughts were flowing like wine. This is all sci fi but I think or hope maybe it's a start. Gravity is a force of mass so perhaps the concept we think of in terms of space travel and leaving earth orbits starts in the quantum small realm. Altering the molecular mass of an object via electro magentic influence,particle manipulation and multiplying energy from small sources to large ones is the key like lightning starting from nearly nothing. You see the idea of infinite energy needed is false since energy comes from nearly zero to infinity from nowhere.  I don't know how but when you eliminate mass to negate gravity you also take away g forces so we can leave the planet in 3 seconds. Once there the concept is continued using the environment of space on the quantum level like dark matter and other unknown variables as a prime factor to go the speed of light as a mas less entity with zero g forces. You see it's like water in an invisible force field as space and gravity you don't propel with more force needing more power this only increases the counter effect instead you simply go through. Gravity can be negated and plowed through like a knife in hot butter,then you take that concept into the light,and quantum realm from mass of the craft use the environment and go right through it up to the speed of light as a photon with zero mass with photonic shields 10 light years at a time an just go maybe? ha ha it was a haze...",I came up with this the other night any opinions on this theoretical idea for space travel?

space,"So a conversation on /r/boardgames started talking about possibility of [playing cards in space in order to pass the time on a trip to Mars](https://redd.it/d1y47p). Curious about how that would work I did some google searches and while I found quite a few sites talking about astronauts playing games, including many that mentioned them playing cards, none went into the mechanics of how that works in zero gravity.

Given their low mass, I would think that regular playing cards would float away with air currents in zero gravity, and the solutions I can think of to hold them down on a table would either create problems when shuffling the deck, such as velcro and magnets, or take up too much space, such as an air suction surface. Though I suppose an air suction surface could be used for other things. Regardless I'm now really curious as to how astronauts manage to place cards down in zero gravity or if they just play games that focus more on holding cards in the hand like Cribbage and am hoping someone here knows the answer.",How do astronauts play cards in space

I always remember the simple process of loading the shuttle on the SCA required a lot of sophisticated rigging, was this rigging built at the airports 'just-in-case', and if not, what was the plan to get the orbiter back to the US?

I've been working on this project for several months now and I'm super excited to share it with you finally.

Rocket Lab Companion is the one-stop place to get everything Rocket Lab. Being a fan myself (obviously) I always want to know when things are happening; so I made this. The app includes things such as Electron statistics, launchpad information and previous/upcoming lanches.

I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed developed it!

Over the coming weeks and months, I'm going to be adding to it further. Some features currently in the pipeline include:

* Launch Push Notification
* The ability to add launches to your calendar of choice.
* A news section so you can keep up to date on the latest developments.

I'm always open to feedback and feature requests so shoot me a PM or contact me through the app if you have any ideas.

The app is completely free and always will be. It's currently only available on the Google Play Store, however, I'm looking into making it available on iOS in the coming months. Let me know if you want this!

**Google Play Link**: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mozaa.rl\_companion](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mozaa.rl_companion&amp;hl=en)

Thanks for reading this and I hope you like it. One again, any suggestions or feedback shoot me a PM or email.

I don't know if this is a good place to put this but I wanted to share it with you. If this is the wrong place let me know and I'll take it down. 

Have a great morning, afternoon or evening!
