stocks,"&gt; Upwork Inc. operates an online marketplace that enables businesses (clients) to find and work with various independent professionals and agencies (freelancers). The company's platform provides access to talent with approximately 5,000 skills across approximately 70 categories, including content marketing, customer service, data science and analytics, graphic design, mobile development, sales, and Web development. Its platform also enables clients to streamline workflows, such as talent sourcing, outreach, and contracting. In addition, the company's platform offers access to various functionalities for remote engagements with freelancers comprising communication and collaboration, time tracking, invoicing, and payment. Further, its marketplace offerings include Upwork Standard, Upwork Enterprise, and Upwork Payroll, as well as managed and Internet escrow agency services. The company has opeations in the United States, India, the Philippines, and internationally. The company was formerly known as Elance-oDesk, Inc. and changed its name to Upwork Inc. in May 2015. Upwork Inc. was incorporated in 2013 and is headquartered in Mountain View, California. 

Currenly the stock is at almost 52 week low (trading at 14.7). It's Market cap is only 1.57B$ and I think there will be a much bigger market for freelancing platforms as more and more work is done remotely. I can honestly see this stock as the next big tech stock. They keep getting more and more users (20% increase year over year) and their only true competitor right now is Fiverr and they really lack in substance and talent pool that Upwork has. Looking at their financials it is very possible that they will become profitable within the next two quarters. The only potential downsides that I see is bigger tech companies getting into freelancing work market (like Microsoft's Linkedin or Slack trying to make their own platform) that could potentially harm them, but as far as I know Upwork is a #1 place where clients and freelancers go to find their partners.

stocks,"I know on paper tesla looks terrifying but the vast majority of drivers drive I.C.E. cars (internal combustion engine, another word for gasoline vehicles). Currently in 2019 I think only less than 2% of cars on the road are electric, this means there is A LOT of room for growth. On top of this Tesla already produces the best of the best electric vehicles and old car manufactures are unable to compete. Tesla is decades ahead on technology compared to the rest of the world when it comes to electric vehicles. It quite funny, other car companies are releasing electric vehicles in 2019 that don't even beat Teslas very first car that came out in 2012! I'm very bullish on this case alone but tesla has so many other avenues for growth it's truly mind boggling. I'll quickly summarize the other growth factor and can go in more detail if you're interested.

1. Self driving vehicles, tesla is working on self driving vehicles which could allow them to have their own ""uber"" company in the future. Once again, tesla is wayyyyy ahead on the competition when it come to self driving. (They also plan on selling self driving semi trucks within the next few years and Elon estimates that car will be 100% self drivable in less than 5 years. (I'm really excited for this because self driving cars are a lot safer than human driven cars, and less traffic because self driving cars are also statically proven to be much more efficient!

2. Self driving cars leads me to my second point, tesla insurance. Elon has his own insurance for Teslas because Teslas are statistically way safer cars (and will become safer as self driving is implemented) I don't know much about insurance tbh but I know Warren buffet got rich off of buying an insurance company and Elon has his own the far exceeds what other companies offer (only for Teslas which is kinda creating its own ecosystem, same with their tesla ""uber"" service

3. Tesla has a premium super charger network. So basically this means if you need to fill up your tesla, you have to go to a charging station, similar to a gas station, the only difference is when you fill up you're giving your money to tesla, so it's almost like tesla owns the gas stations aswell! Also tesla allows other vehicles to charge at their stations which means more $ for tesla. Also no other car company has even 1/10 of the amount of charging stations as tesla.

4. Solar roofing tiles/ battery storage. As if there aren't enough reasons to be bullish on tesla I saved the best for last. So tesla can essentially save every person (who lives in a sunny state) money by installing solar panels on their roof, they can do it cheaper than most other companies aswell and their tech is very impressive. Buying their solar panels is a no brainer and can the original cost to buy the solar panels pays itself off in about a year. Also they can install a battery into your house which you can use to charge your tesla (for free) and you can even sell the electric you don't use back to the grid or just use it for your house... so like I said it's a no brainer to get especially if someone live in a sunny state.

Random other thoughts, once a democratic politician gets in office, there will likely be huge incentives to both electric cars and solar panels, may as well buy in now while theres a ton of ridiculous news going on about tesla. Also keep in mind Elon musk is a brilliant human who owns space X which makes them loads and loads of money which Elon uses for tesla, also Elon can raise money with a snap of a finger, so Tesla isn't actually in a danger like the media loves to portray. Also Elon musk is really popular among the youth, he's in a lot of memes, tons of popular youtubers have Teslas and constantly praise the vehicle so all those viewers will consider buying a tesla and all the kids that idolize Elon will also likely buy a tesla.

Oh my, I almost forgot..... Elon is about to finish the tesla gigafactory in China and Elon is also on the board of China's envirmomental government agency or something like that (he has an ""in"" with china) and china is also a HUGE market for electric vehicles. I'm sure there's more I'm forgetting but yea I'm bullish on tesla :)

Edit: one more thing I just remembered, tesla is completely self integrated, they produce all of their parts in house and they just bought Maxwell Technologies and will make their own batteries which is a huge deal (no other car company does that) Elon even ""joked"" about getting into the mining business and mining the minerals they need instead of buying it from others.",Why I'm bullish on tesla off the top of my head

stocks,"I don't exactly remember how I stumbled upon MTFB (Motif Bio), but I did. I did some digging to see why they dropped from $11 a share to $.7 in one day in February.


On February 13th of this year their staple new antibiotic, Iclaprim, failed to provide enough data to the NDA to support the drugs approval. At the time their stock was valued ~$11. In 3 days it plummeted 86%.

They've had several meetings and clinical trials of the antibiotic with people that faced a rare condition called Listeria. On September 19th this week they have another meeting set with the NDA to go over their findings and next steps.

In the past month MTFB has grown 40% in anticipation for this meeting and if it goes well, who knows how high it could skyrocket.

So I guess my question would be, if this company with only 300K volume is able to have a successful meeting with the NDA tomorrow, is this a solid (but risky) investment.",MTFB's mid-term future

I personally think the long game sounds like a huge risk as well as the fact the price of stock will ALWAYS drop below it started for a short period and always rise again. So in that every instance I profit just reput it back into something else where as if the person who waits will get a set amount but I'm capitalizing on the profits daily as well as reinvesting more so technically I'm getting more long run. If y'all think I'm wrong please explain why. As for dividends it seems too slow and pointless unless you just don't want to put the time into flips and want automatic mindless money but you also run the risk of stock dropping price.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

stocks,"First some context. The question came up in discussion whether or not ETFs were ""safe"". The theory goes that an ETF is essentially a vehicle that requires a buyer in order to sell. So if there were far more sellers than buyers, the ETF could essentially tank far faster than the value of the individual stocks within the ETF. This is not unlike a stock. However, when an individual stock goes bankrupt, the share holders are entitled to funds. I'm uncertain what would happen when a company goes bankrupt and you own an ETF. My understanding is that the ETF physically owns an appropriate share of the 500 companies.

“The next big catalyst \[for Bitcoin\] is a decisive breakout in the equity markets,” he told CNBC’s Fast Money on Thursday. “Once equities break to an all-time high, Bitcoin becomes a risk-on asset.” For Lee, it seems clear: as stocks go high, Bitcoin follows.

# **Week ahead: The stock market is poised to set a new record if the Federal Reserve delivers  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/13/week-ahead-the-stock-market-is-poised-to-set-a-new-record-if-the-federal-reserve-delivers.html)**
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by a quarter point on Wednesday, but what it says about its future plans will determine whether stocks continue their run at record highs.
*****
&gt; Tensions around this month’s rates meeting decision are high. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell faces dissent from within the Fed board from some members who don’t believe the economy is weak enough to warrant cutting rates. Two members opposed the last rate cut, and even more could oppose this one.
*****
&gt; The Fed is also under pressure from financial markets that threw a tantrum earlier this summer on concern the Fed was moving too slowly to stave off a recession. On top of that, the Fed faces an unprecedented level of criticism from the White House, with President Donald Trump repeatedly criticizing the Fed board and Powell, himself, for not cutting interest rates fast enough. This week, the president went so far as to call Fed officials “boneheads” and demanded they take the fed funds rate to zero or even a negative level.
*****
&gt; Against this backdrop, the stock market is flirting with new highs, as the Fed joins other central banks to ease policy, in the face of a global economic slowdown. Stocks were higher for the week and on Friday trading less than one percent below July’s all-time highs in the Dow and S&amp;P 500. The Dow ended the week 1.6% higher at 27,219, while the S&amp;P 500 was up just about 1% at 3,007, 21 points away from its all-time high.
*****
&gt; The market was boosted by signs there could be progress in trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, as each side held off on some new tariffs, ahead of formal talks in October.
*****
&gt; “It’s been good news all around for the markets this week. You have thawing of trade tensions. You have more central bank easing, and you have Goldilocks economic data. Investors are thrilled...and that’s why you have markets just fractionally below all-time highs,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
*****
&gt; Riding on the Fed
&gt; The Fed stands to disappoint markets if it does not explicitly promise more easing. The Fed could do that in the quarterly projection of interest rate forecasts, which will be issued with its economic projections after the meeting. Fed officials include forecasts for growth and inflation, besides interest rates, which appear in a chart known as the “dot plot.”.
*****
&gt; “The question is will the Fed signal a willingness to keep going with rate cuts, or will they suggest this mid-cycle adjustment is nearing its end. My view is they’re not going to back themselves into a corner, and they’re going to give themselves plenty of room to cut again at some point,” Arone said. “That’s going to be the biggest risk right now. The markets are pricing in a number of rate cuts in the next few quarters and will the Fed deliver on that...That will be a friction point.”
*****
&gt; U.S. data in the past week has been largely better-than-expected, with August’s retail sales up 0.4%, continuing a stronger trend, on the back of improved auto sales. The dilemma for the Fed, however, could be the fact that both producer and consumer level inflation picked up in August, with core CPI reaching 2.4%, its highest year over year growth pace since 2008. That is well above the Fed’s 2% target, but the Fed prefers to watch PCE inflation, which is running at about 1.6%.
*****
&gt; On the calendar in the coming week is Empire State manufacturing Monday; industrial production Tuesday; housing starts Wednesday, and existing home sales and the Philadelphia Fed survey Thursday. But it’s the Fed that will resonate more with markets.
*****
&gt; “We they think they’ll cut 25 [basis points]. We think it will be a pretty even split between half the committee looking for one more cut and the rest looking for no action,” said Kevin Cummins, senior economist at NatWest Markets. The Fed shaved the fed funds target rate range by a quarter point, to 2.00 to 2.25% in July.
*****
&gt; Some strategists haves said the more dissents, the more it would add to increased market volatility, since the Fed outlook becomes much more uncertain if Fed officials are not more uniformly supporting policy actions.
*****
&gt; Cummins said he expects the Fed’s post-meeting statement to reflect slightly softer economic activity in July, and it will likely mentioning that the labor market may be just “solid,” instead of “strong” and that job gains have moderated.
*****
&gt; “That leaves the door open for more [rate cuts]. The dot plot shows another cut by the end of the year. You could make the case they’ll pause in October if things remain the same,” he said, adding they could also resume in December.
*****
&gt; Calmer markets
&gt; The Fed faces much calmer markets than it would have in August, when trade tensions increased with Trump’s tweet threatening more tariffs on China. Stocks have been rising as bond yields come off August lows, and traders are now pricing in a 25 basis point cut this week and one more for this year and another next year.
*****
&gt; As Treasury yields fell to record and multi-year lows in August, the futures market had priced as many as three more Fed rate cuts fort his year. Since then the 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, has rebounded to 1.90%— more than 45 basis points off its low.
*****
&gt; The more than 30 basis points move in the 10-year yield in the past week, was the largest weekly move since November, 2016.
*****
&gt; Trade developments could also move markets in the coming week, just as they have in the past week. Analyst say the market is most vulnerable if there’s a negative surprise. Trump’s tweet on trade Aug. 1, threatening more tariffs on China, created a new round of turbulence in markets.
*****
&gt; “It’s kind of ironic. Without the U.S. China trade conflict, the Fed wouldn’t be cutting rates at all, and yet President Trump continues to bash them to cut rates,” Arone said.
*****
&gt; Arone said the bigger overriding driver for the market is in fact the trade negotiations, and he said the markets may be too optimistic in expectations for a trade deal.
*****
&gt; “There’s an inherent kind of risk to the markets if in fact, tensions escalate again,” he said.

# Long-Term Treasury ETF (TLT) Has 2nd Biggest Weekly Drop Ever

&gt; Outside of equities, we saw a massive move higher in Treasury yields this week and a massive drop in Treasury bond prices. For the 20+ year Treasury ETF (TLT), this week's 6.34% drop was its second worst week on record since it began trading back in 2002.

&gt; Below is a look at TLT's historical weekly percentage change, and we also show how TLT has performed in the weeks and months following one-week drops of more than 5% like we saw this week. As shown in the table, TLT has normally continued lower for a while following big down weeks.

# S&amp;P 500 Nearing ATHs But Individual Sectors Not So Much

&gt; The past week has been a solid run for the US equity market as a whole. The S&amp;P 500 continues to edge ever closer to prior all-time highs; opening today within half a percent of this level. As shown in the chart below, on average across all sectors, though, it is a little bit less optimistic. The average sector is still 6.5% below record highs. Excluding energy, which is by far the furthest (in terms of price and time) from its all-time high, the average across sectors jumps up to 3.6%. Consumer Staples and Utilities are the only sectors within 1% of their highs while the Tech sector is not far behind only 1.5% away.

# Betting Markets and the Election

&gt; One way to keep track of the evolving Presidential primaries and general election news is the website electionbettingodds.com which shows what the betting market is predicting for upcoming election outcomes. In the charts below, we show the current probabilities of a primary and general election win for each of the various candidates (officially announced and otherwise) with a 1% or higher chance of winning. Elizabeth Warren now has a commanding lead in the Democrats' primary with a 34.9% chance of victory with Biden and Sanders in second and third.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091319-Election1u.png))**

&gt; Where things get more interesting is to figure out which candidates have the best chance of winning the general election assuming they win their primary. For example, President Trump's odds of winning his primary are 88.1%, but his odds of winning the general election for the Presidency are priced at 43.7%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091319-Election2u.png))**

&gt; By dividing that 43.7% by the 88.1% chance of primary victory we can get to a 49.6% general election pricing assuming the candidate wins their primary. This conditional probability probably shouldn't be taken too seriously, but it's got some interesting results. Among candidates polling over 5%, Beto O'Rourke has the highest odds (80%) of a general election win if he takes the primary while other Democratic hopefuls Andrew Yang and Bernie Sanders are priced at 60%+ odds. Biden's general election odds are at 55% if he wins the primary, while Warren -- the current front runner -- is at 49.9%. Notably, although Trump is close at 49.6%, no Republican has a conditional priced probability over 50% to win the general.

&gt; All of that said, these conditional relationships can be very unstable and are complicated to arbitrage, so we probably shouldn't place too much faith in the detail of their message, but it's still interesting to see that markets are implicitly optimistic about the electability of a candidate like Sanders or Yang relative to more mainstream candidates like Warren, Harris, or Biden.

# Copper Unconsolidated

&gt; In last night's Closer, we noted the recent price action of copper. Over the past several months, copper had been consistently moving lower in a solid downtrend, but that downtrend has been broken this week. Finishing up about 1% in yesterday's session, copper had its first close above resistance which would suggest a further move higher. We're seeing additional gains today as the commodity continues to break out. Over the next few weeks, copper bulls will look for a series of higher highs and higher lows that would eventually form a new uptrend.

# best and WORST S&amp;P 1500 Stocks Since 9/6

&gt; This week has been all about little is big and big is little in terms of stock performance. Take the lists of best and worst performing S&amp;P 1500 stocks since last Friday's close. The first table below shows the 20 best performing S&amp;P 1500 stocks since the close last Friday. The fact that there are more than 20 stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 that are up over 20% already this week is notable in itself. Even crazier, though, is that when you look at the share prices of these stocks, all but seven have current share prices of less than $5 per share even after their gains this week, and the average share price of the 20 stocks listed is just $7.42. Also, as we noted in an earlier post, it's not as if there are tons of stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 trading below $5 per share. Heading into today, there were only 55 and 54 of them were up on the week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091219-Best-Stocks.png))**

&gt; Turning to the list of losers so far this week, while there are more than 20 stocks that are up over 20%, not a single stock in the index is down 20% and only eight are down more than 10%. Besides the fact that the stocks listed below are down so far this week and the ones above are up, the other major and pretty consistent difference between the two lists is their share prices. As of today, the average price of the 20 biggest losers so far this week is $135.74 which is more than 18 times the average share price of the biggest week to date winners.

# Throw It All Out the Window

&gt; It's time to throw all those financial ""mumbo jumbo"" ratios out the window. That's right. You can take your P/E, P/B, P/S ratios and send them out packing with EV/EBITDA and the PEG ratio. While you're at it, why don't you free up some space and toss out all those finance textbooks you bought in college and grad school. None of it matters. At least not this week where making money in the market has been as simple as ""buy low and sell high.""

&gt; Through yesterday's close, the S&amp;P 1500, which is comprised of large-caps (S&amp;P 500), mid-caps (S&amp;P 400), and small-caps (S&amp;P 600), was up just under 1% on the week. The average week to date performance of individual stocks in the index, however, was a much more impressive gain of 5%. By far the biggest gains have come from the stocks with the lowest share prices. Coming into the week, there were 55 stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 that had share prices of less than $5, and through Wednesday's close, they were up an average of 21% with 54 of 55 in the black. 21%!!!! Coming into today, there were also seven stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 that were already up over 40% this week, and guess what? They all came into the week with share prices below $5.

&gt; Looking at the performance of individual stocks this week shows that share prices appear to have been a key driver of performance. In the chart below, we grouped stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 based on their share prices as of last Friday and then calculated the average performance of the stocks in each group so far this week (through Wednesday's close). While stocks with share prices of less than $5 per share were up an average of 20.8%, the performance of stocks priced between $5 and $10 per share were up a still impressive 10.9%. What's even crazier about this chart is the fact that as you move out to the right (higher share prices), average performance consistently weakens to the point where stocks with high share prices ($100+) have only gained an average of 0.1% so far this week. Who needs Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMAZN) and Chipotle (CMG) when you could have had JC Penney (JCP), Dean Foods (DF), or Mallinckrodt (MNK). If these high priced stocks know what's good for them, they better start announcing 10-1 splits pronto! (That was a joke.)

&gt; In all seriousness, the performance numbers listed below further illustrate this week's massive rotation out of momentum strategies, where stocks and sectors that had been leading have been sold off while those that had lagged or been written off for dead have seen some buying interest or at least an easing of selling pressure. All the textbooks and financial ratios in the world may provide comfort to analysts and investors, but they don't help at all when the momentum tide turns.

# Small Cap Surge

&gt; Small caps have been serial underperformers versus the large-cap S&amp;P 500 over the last 12+ months, but they're having their day in the sun this week. Not only has the small-cap Russell 2,000 risen more than 1% for three consecutive trading days to start the week, but the index has also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than one percentage point on each of the last three days.

&gt; If this is the start of a longer-term small cap resurgence, there is certainly a lot of runway left. Below is a chart of the ratio between the S&amp;P 500 and the Russell 2,000 over the last 15 years. When the line is rising, the S&amp;P is outperforming the Russell. When the line is falling, the Russell is outperforming the S&amp;P.

&gt; As you can see in the chart, the S&amp;P has been outperforming the Russell for the last year, and the ratio got extended to the very top of its 15-year range at the start of September. Since peaking earlier this month, however, the ratio has fallen dramatically as small caps have started to outperform. Even after the recent small-cap outperformance, the ratio remains well above its long-term average.

# Time For Gold To Shine?

&gt; “The higher the base, the higher in space,” is an old technical analysis saying.

&gt; Gold is up 18% year-to-date (as of 9/10/2019), poised for its best year since 2010, when it gained 30%. We see many reasons why this rally may have legs.

&gt; Last year’s action was rare: The S&amp;P 500 Index, 10-year U.S. Treasuries, and gold were all lower. Going back to 1971, when gold was officially removed from the gold standard, last year was the first year that all three assets were lower in a calendar year. Now in 2019, all three assets are up significantly, quite a difference from last year!

&gt; Gold and stocks have trended the same way: Since 1980, stocks and gold both have risen in 19 of those 39 years, and both have fallen in only four years. Somewhat surprisingly, both were up more than 10% in eight of those years. Gold might be viewed as “defensive,” but history shows there can be times when both gold and stocks have had nice gains together.

&gt; “Gold is breaking out to new highs after doing nothing for years,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Concerns over the global slowdown, $17 trillion in negative yielding debt, inverted yield curves, and central banks stepping up their gold purchases have all pushed the yellow metal out of a picture-perfect base.”

&gt; Technicals support a rally: As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, gold completed a nice-looking six-year saucer bottom and broke out above previous resistance. As the quote at the start of the blog noted, when things base for years, the potential move can be quite explosive.

&gt; A well-deserved pullback may present an opportunity for suitable investors to add exposure in appropriate strategies.

# S&amp;P 500 up 13 of last 16 September option expiration weeks

&gt; September’s option expiration week is up 62.2% of the time for S&amp;P 500 since 1982. DJIA and NASDAQ have slightly weaker track records with gains 56.8% of the time and 59.5% of the time respectively. However, the week has suffered several sizable losses. The worst loss followed the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In the last sixteen years, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are tied for best record during September’s option expiration week, up thirteen times. Friday had been firm with all three indices advancing every year 2004 to 2011, but S&amp;P 500 has been down six of the last seven since.

**Stockmarket**

The stock market edged up this week as continuing delays and compromises continued to emerge regarding the imposition of tariffs.  Tech stocks did experience a light sell off on Tuesday but, after large recent gains, it amounted to a minor correction at worst and was largely reversed by the close on Friday.

**Small Caps**

1.Aspen Group, the online university, jumped on Tuesday after the company reported a 43% increase in quarterly revenue.  Growth has really taken off since 2017 when the college offered an affordable monthly fee for nurses wishing to qualify for their online Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) masters degree. Pricing it 30%-40% cheaper than alternatives, growth in enrollments has been massive.  That’s understandable given the average increase in a nurse's salary is greater than the cost of the degree itself. It also means that, on average, the degrees pay for themselves within one year.  Valued at just three times trailing revenues the stock looks cheap 

2. Funko, the leading producer of pop culture collectibles, finished the week up 16% after analysts following GameStop took great comfort from GamesStop CFO’s comments that;

“Our collectibles business is a great example. It continues to positively expand, posting a 21% year-over-year increase in the second quarter exceeding our expectations and marking the 15th consecutive quarter of growth with 14 out of the 15 in double digits.”

Short of naming Funko by name that clearly indicated Funko is having another great quarter.  What is less apparent is why investors needed reassurance.  Funko announced a considerable beat and raise only a few weeks ago with revenues up 38% and full year EPS expected to increase 45%.  Funko has become the benchmark for pop culture popularity putting its distinctive stamp on almost every major franchise in popular culture, namely a series of small highly stylized, vaguely anime-looking figures that have become a retail sensation. The company now has more than 1,100 licenses, including Harry Potter, Avengers, Star Wars, Pokemon, My Little Pony and Spongebob Squarepants.  

Funko has also been branching out of collectibles and into apparel and gaming in recent years.  Most recently, makeup has become the latest line with the company noting the huge overlap between fans who love makeup and those who love to collect Funko Pops. 

All in all the current valuation at 22x current year EPS estimates looks very reasonable.

**Special Situations (China)**

3. Changyou.com ADS jumped 50% on Monday to $9.00 after Sohu offered $10 to buy out all remaining outstanding stock.  That still leaves potentially 11% upside for investors who want to buy in now.  Admittedly the offer is non-binding but is unlikely to be rejected as Sohu already has a controlling interest of 68% and 90% of the voting rights. Changyou, after all, was only spun off by Sohu ten years ago. An article in Fool.com says that it is possible that the Board, which consists of independent directors, could block the deal.  However, the Board is elected each year at the AGM so I would consider this to be highly unlikely.

**Pharmaceuticals**

4. Acadia Pharmaceuticals jumped 70% on Monday after pleasantly surprising analysts with blockbuster potential for its treatment (Pimavanserin) in dementia psychosis. A successful phase 3 result is obviously not equivalent to an approval but the news was well received given the expected $25,000 annual charge and 1.2 million potential patients.  Back of the envelope, that yields a potential TAM of $30bn compared to a market cap of $5.8 billion (as Friday’s close).  

**Large Caps**

5. One stock that suffered worse than other tech stocks during the week was Universal Display, the organic light emitting diodes (OLED) research company, which dropped 10% on Tuesday and finished the week 22% off 52 week highs after an analyst downgrade with a weaker smartphone outlook.  However the pullback looks like an opportunity for investors to back the huge opportunity that surrounds OLEDs in television and lighting.  Demand for OLEDs is expected to triple over the next 5 years and Universal Display owns patents on the most energy efficient OLED technologies.  The company will collect its royalties no matter who manufactures the OLEDs and, given its asset light and highly scalable business model, increasing revenues will likely lead to an exponential increase in profits.  That can be seen in consensus forecasts which point to a 55% increase in revenues this year while EPS should grow 120%. Consequently its valuation (even with a trailing PE of 75) doesn’t look particularly high. 

6. RH jumped 5% on Wednesday after the luxury lifestyle retailer reported a blow out quarter with second-quarter adjusted EPS of $3.20 increasing 60% yoy and beating forecasts by 19%. The company raised EPS guidance by 15% and now expects full year EPS of $10.65 at the midpoint (compared to $7.31 last year).  RH’s core business has been a big winner as it has focused on delivering the most favorable shopping experience while cutting under performing lines to boost margins.  RH thinks it can do more.  During the call CEO Gary Friedman said sales in California alone could almost double from $450 million today to $700 million-$800 million. A considerable amount for a company that generated sales of $2.2 billion in 2019. However the biggest opportunity is international growth with the UK alone potentially generating sales of $1.1 billion and total international sales estimated at four times the size of North America.  RH’s stock is up significantly over the past few years but, with the long term outlook for 8%-12% growth, the valuation (at 16x forecast 2019 earnings) does not look expensive.

**Insider Buying/Selling**

7. REV Group CEO Timothy Sullivan bought $0.5 million of stock on Wednesday, one week after the company reported a disappointing Q3 that saw the stock price drop 30%.  Mr Sullivan asserted then that business fundamentals remained strong with the exception of softness in the RV market.  That was backed up on Thursday when the company announced an $80 million bus order.  Sizeable for a company with a $650 million market capitalization. 

8. Finally, when the CEO sells $5 million of stock after the price has fallen 50% it sends a pretty negative signal to investors.  Thats what happened when Merit Medical Systems CEO and President Fred Lampropoulos offloaded stock on Tuesday.  He still holds about $27 million of stock but this is Mr Lampropoulos’ second sale since the company reported a second quarter miss and cut guidance.  The outlook isn’t good.

stocks,"Sorry if this is not the place to ask this but I got more of a general/curiosity question. How does the price of a stock really go up and down in price? So lets say a new stock becomes public and there's 100,000 shares and it's set at $10 (Side question I suppose, how is it that one stock has X shares and starts at Y price while another stock has different available shares and starts at a different price). I'm the first in line and I buy some share at $10. Based on this, does the price of the stock go up? If the answer to this is yes, hypothetically, can't I just instantly sell the shares and make a profit? If the answer is no, what makes the price go up? And does this mean that as long as no one is re-selling their bought stock, everyone next in line can buy the stock at $10 a pop till they fully run out of shares?

I get that there's supply and demand, but I don't quite understand how the value of the stock is determined. Like in my previous example, as soon as I buy the stock which is set at $10 what happens next? Does the stock go up for the next person waiting to buy in line, does that person also get it at $10?

Thanks a lot for helping me understand! :)",How does a stock move up and down in price?

The rising tide  of gold prices, which have remained at the $1,500 per ounce level (or  higher), only partially explains the keener investor attention Galane  has attracted. Galane’s current stock price has found a new plateau of  about $0.07/share – almost 20% higher. But, there’s more upside,  considering the solid fundamentals. These fundamentals are, as the term  suggests, the very basics of any business: good and old-fashioned  production and sale of goods, otherwise known as revenue and earnings.

ast August 15, Galane issued its 2019 Q2  financials, which were full of important ‘fundamentals’ in the strictest  sense of the term. Focusing on the highlights, Galane produced 8,692  ounces of gold in and sold 8,700 ounces in the second quarter at an  average of $1,305/oz. The highlight, however, was the fact that Galane  secured $2.889 million in cash-flow from operating activities at its *Mupane*gold  mine: the most important gold producer in Botswana. At well over 8,600  ounces in the second quarter, Galane is well on its way to achieving (or  surpassing) its yearly gold production target of 32,000 ounces.  Moreover, in neighboring South Africa, Galane has launched production at  the revamped *Galaxy Project*, located in the Barberton Greenstone  Belt – host to some of the most prolific gold deposits in the world.  Greenstone Belt, as it happens’ is not just a name. It refers to a  well-known geological formation, known to be rich in mineral deposits  from silver to zinc. 

**Most notably, greenstone belts contain gold**.

Galane’s Galaxy covers some 58.6  km² of the Barberton Greenstone Belt and the company remains in track  to achieve full commercial production in mid-2020. Galane refurbished an  old facility and started to produce concentrate, achieving more than  initially expected, such that it has a target production of some 2,300 ounces  of payable gold (and at much higher prices than in the second quarter,  given current trends and higher global geopolitical and macroeconomic  uncertainty) to be produced by the end of 2019 from the Galaxy project.  Moreover, Galane believes it will be able to sustain an average annual  production of 25,000 ounces of gold at operating costs (cash cost per  ounce) lower than $800. Now, consider that gold prices will be some  $200/oz. higher in Q3 (and most likely in Q4) to better appreciate the  earnings potential of a gold miner such as Galane: at current production  levels alone, the gold price differential would add about $1.74 million  in cash-flow.  

Effectively, Galane  represents a largely de-risked proposition -involving well-known  orebodies, which have been mined since 1888 – for investors wanting to  take advantage of gold mining stocks, as the markets are showing ever  clearer signals of uncertainty and volatility. And the resource is quite  simply-there are no other words to describe it-huge. In fact, Galane is  surrounded by large scale neighbors such as Pan-African Resources,  which has produced annual amounts in the range of 90,000 to 95,000  ounces for years.Of course, what happened in  the past is not going to move the stock price in the future. But the  past does offer than adequate assurances that Galane will be in a  position to deliver results. It boasts orebodies, which the market  expects, and it has the infrastructure in place to boost production. In  2020, as Phase II of the project gets underway, Galane plans to double  the milling  (and a suitable mill has already been built) and mining  capacity. The additional costs needed to ramp-up operations will be  easily financed thanks to the higher earnings made possible by the  higher gold price. 

Galane has used modern technology and mining  techniques to refurbish two well-established mining operations,  respectively in Botswana and South Africa. Galane is not trying to find  adequate gold concentrations to define the best ore concentration zones:  Galane already has two proven resources and Galane has already started  to deliver revenues. This makes it a rare find in the junior space,  which is typically filled with ‘potential’ rather than real and ‘actual’  opportunity. Apart from the mine’s established mineralogical  characteristics and production capacity, senior professionals with years  of experience in mining, processing and large-scale exploration.",Galane Gold (CVE:GG) Offers a De-Risked Way to Gain from the Rising Gold Price

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

stocks,"TDLR: I made a spreadsheet that tracks your portfolio and dividends automatically. I also talk about the different tools the spreadsheet has.

**ABOUT ME:**

Hi! I'm 19 years old and I'm from Quebec, Canada. I'm just a normal dude who is passionate about finance and I love to connect through Reddit! I'm pursuing an MBA. I don't do finance as my full-time job at the moment so it is more like a hobby. I'm from North America, so this spreadsheet is built for CAD and USD. You can change the exchange rates if needed. Those will automatically be updated. (For more info on the script see below) I'm also a huge fan of DGI (Dividend Growth Investing) and I love to keep tracking everything, and this is why I came up with this wonderful spreadsheet after a lot of work. I think this is a must to have for everyone here!

**WHAT DOES THE SPREADSHEET DO?**

I've created an automated spreadsheet that pulls information from google finance and gives me an overview of my current portfolio. It also converts my portfolio into different graphs that are updated automatically when reloading. All you have to do is type in the symbol and the amount and it works. Every quote is updated every 10 min. It then calculates if I made money or lost money and how big the stake of each position is compared to others. It is really helpful. With this spreadsheet, I can also see the outlook of my portfolio, future dividends, the evolution of my portfolio, my monthly income, and my growth.

Plus, the spreadsheet contains multiple tools you can use.

**TOOLS:**

*Profit Calculator-* help you to calculate the gross profit/shares, gross margin profit, and total profit by taking account of your transaction fees.

*Account Positions-* Useful for keeping track of your portfolio (Dividends, Buy Price, Cost basis, gain/loss, growth, gameplan, and weight with a portfolio outlook diagram)

*Account tracking-* I'm investing in a TFSA with my bank and by myself so it is important to keep track of my contributions. It can also provide information about your other accounts. (like a Roth IRA etc.)

*Gross Valuation of Companies-* Calculate the gross intrinsic value of a stock. Also, it calculates the discount and potential of the stock to see which stock is undervalued. (This is gross evaluation, you shouldn't make any financial decisions only based on this)

*Golden ETF Reloads-* Golden stock to reload with your dividends. I discuss my strategy more below.

*Buying Lists-* Your grocery list but for stock. (Base on MY criteria, stocks might not suit you)

*Golden rules-* Those are the rules that I follow. I think those are fundamental principles. You do what you want.

**THE SCRIPT:**

It is a basic script that will automatically update the share prices every 10 minutes. You need to accept it since it will update your stock quotes (**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Don't buy base on those prices since they can be delayed by 20 min even if you refresh the share price. See [this](https://www.google.com/googlefinance/disclaimer/) for more information) I won't have access to anything on your sheet. The script respects everything about the Global Data Privacy Policy. [Here is a screenshot of the script.](https://imgur.com/a/T0D0uYu)

**HOW TO USE:**

1-Make a copy and save it to your drive so you can edit it. (accept the automated script) Have fun with it.

2-Modify Currency (with the exchange rates). Simply modify the exchange rate inside the double quotation marks example: =GOOGLEFINANCE(""CURRENCY:CADUSD"")for the exchange cad to USD. You might need to adapt your spreadsheet manually if needed.

3-Type the symbols and values into the fields I marked in grey. Contributions have to be negative! (E.g. if you invested USD2000 you need to type in -2000)

4-Fill the monthly tracking tool. (More details below)

5-Delete all other rows you don’t need

???

6-Profit

**SETTING UP THE MONTHLY DIVIDEND TRACKER:**

1-Add/move enough rows as needed.

2-Click and drag the months and quarters data to the top

3-Fill the monthly dividend amount (=actual income you earned) and the portfolio value as of the month. (If you don’t know, start your tracking from today)

4-Adjust the range of data in your diagrams where needed. Track your 12 months for the total dividend forecast.

We created Haystak and are looking for Beta testers! Check it out at [https://haystak.ai/](https://haystak.ai/)

***It is completely free to use*** 

Check it out at https://haystak.ai/

**Situation**  
We worked in finance. We used tools for technical analysis every day when making investment and trading decisions.

**Complication**  
No existing technical analysis tools test the predictive power of price patterns when they form in the markets. Most people look for commonly accepted patterns, without knowing if they are valid or not. In reality, they typically rely on outdated theory and other people's opinion when making investment and trading decisions.

**Question**  
How do I evaluate the predictive power of current price movements?

**Solution**  
We decided to build Haystak - a tool that help me/you/us make investment and trading decisions and ultimately optimise our capital.

**How does it work?**

1. Pick a stock/FX pair/index/crypto pair
2. The Haystak Engine uses machine learning techniques to find the most similar historic patterns to today's, yesterday's, last week's, or the last two week's (the list goes on...) price movements
3. A Haystak similarity score is computed and displayed
4. The Haystak Engine finds the subsequent returns

I created an easy-to-follow tutorial a few weeks ago on how to create your own simple dividend stock portfolio spreadsheet using Google.

&amp;#x200B;

I did this for 2 reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

\#1 because I have been seeing YouTubers that are selling their portfolio tracking spreadsheets and I thought that people should just learn how to make their own rather than pay for it.

\#2 because someone asked me to make a video showing how I created mine.

# Kambi

**Share Price History**

On the 8th of June 2014 Kambi closed trading at 35.40SEK. In a period of 6 months the share price rose dramatically from 52.50SEK on the 8th of October 2015 to 152.00SEK on the 17th of April 2016. From July 2016 up until July 2018 the share price was in decline and closed trading on the 23rd of July at 67.50SEK. Throughout 2018 and the beginning of 2019 the price continued to rise and closed on the 28th of October at a price of 250SEK. Since that massive peak the price has been dropping (with some small peaks along the way) and closed on the 1st of September at 165.00SEK.^(1)

**Analysis**

* 2016
   * The peak from the beginning of October 2016 was due in part to the agreement between Kambi &amp; Novomatic.^(2)
* 2017
   * In 2017 there was a constant decline in the share price even though deals were reached with 888 holdings^(3), 7777^(4) and a renewal with LeoVegas^(5), seemingly this was due to the big drop in profits (from 1.8m to 100k€) in Q2 in 2017.^(6)
* 2018
   * The ongoing raise between July 2018 and the beginning of 2019 is in part due to deals closed with Draftkings^(7), Global Gaming 555^(8), White hat gaming^(9), Parx^(10), and Kindred^(11).
* 2019
   * On the 21st of July Kambi’s share price was at its lowest in recent times at 130SEK, this seems to be in direct response to the news that DraftKings are looking to drop Kambi^(12).
   * Once a renewal was achieved with DraftKings^(13) the share price jumped up to 167SEK.

**Summary**

The share price has grown in the past 5 years 466% (35.40SEK – 165SEK) which is a large profit for original investors.

Based on the history of the past 5 years, Kambi’s share price is volatile and fluctuates based on deals with large clients and PR. Even mere news about signing or losing a client sends the price to move dramatically.

**Public Projection**

In recent publications and reviews Kambi Group Plc stocks are predicted to continue to raise in the coming years and are considered a reasonable safe investment^(14).

# Our Investigation

**Customers leaving**

* &amp;#x200B;

1. Kambi’s deal with Novomatic up to date is entirely functional and they haven’t signed any deals as a conjoined team, leading to believe that the peak in share price in 2016 was unfulfilled and incorrect.

* 2. Luckia left Kambi back in 2016, quoting ‘the new platform will provide a range of benefits to Luckia, including greater operational flexibility and improved price differentiation. It will also enable the operator to offer unique odds, set its own betting limits and payouts, customise content and marketing, and manage its sportsbook liability in real time^(15).
* 3. 888 Holdings in early 2019 purchased BetBright with a very clear vision of leaving Kambi and very recently announced that they will be in the near future using their own sportsbook.^(16)
* 4. Draftkings are looking to close to deal in buying out SBTech which would point to them dropping Kambi, this is despite them renewing a deal with Kambi^(17).
* 5. Inside reports from a reliable source in R Franco have told our research team that they are in the process of leaving Kambi and signing with another major supplier.

&amp;#x200B;

**Negative Press**

1. Kindred powered by Kambi have been placed on the blacklist in Switzerland^(18), pointing to illegal activity (Kindred are in deeply linked with Kambi - Kambi is B2B subsidiary of UniBet which is the original name of Kindred)^(19)

**Summary**

Looking at the final Quarter of 2019 and the beginning of 2020 the future doesn’t look bright for Kambi. Two of their biggest genuine clients (ignoring their spinoff Unibet) - DraftKings &amp; 888 Holdings are poised to quit, and add to the mix our reports that R Franco are looking to leave Kambi. These moves indicate that Kambi are a product big customers’ are afraid to rely on. In addition we see in other news that that they aren’t as squeaky clean as they proclaim they are.

Since Kambi is a company which its value is solely based on PR and clients, we strongly believe based on our extensive research, contrary to popular belief Kambi’s value is going to drop and its share price will be trading below 100SEK in the near future and continue to drop. If they lose Draftkings and 888 Holdings they will struggle to recover, as Draftkings is their main ticket into the United States.

**Advice**

Based on the analysis and predictions, our advice to our in-house brokers and advisors is to recommend selling Kambi shares and not to purchase. On the bright side, long term investors have earned tremendously from recent growth.

However, we saw strong and better than expected sell through on new merchandise. Our merchant teams have done an excellent job of shifting back to a “read and react” buying and planning strategy, resulting in more nimble buying and planning processes. We believe effective implementation of this data analytic and customer demand strategy is driving a meaningful improvement in both boutique traffic and conversion during the second quarter.  We realized material savings this quarter through a number of cost reduction initiatives that we have been executing since the beginning of fiscal 2019.  In addition, we continue to make headway in optimizing our real estate portfolio. We are extremely pleased with our progress, which we believe is validating our go-forward turnaround strategy and look forward to driving continued positive momentum in the business.”",$FRAN BULLISH MOMENTUM

stocks,"Today I decided to check the price history of Softbank on Marketwatch it said it was around $43. The last update was clearly marked as today, Sept 9, 2019. I immediately thought ""I knew something was wrong! ...so why does my Robinhood account claim it is in the 20's??""

I then exited out of Marketwatch and checked Yahoo, and the price was the same as Robinhood (around $21.) So then I immediately went back into Marketwatch and, lo and behold, the price amount changed to the amount shown on Yahoo and in Robinhood.
Okay, so.... just a glitch perhaps??

However, this leads to my initial concern, and my reason for deciding to check the price outside of my Robinhood app in the first place...

My average purchase price is currently (and has always been) higher than the 52 week high -- and I haven't even owned this stock for 52 weeks. Also, my highest purchase price from back in October 2018 (when I first bought the stock) is WELL OVER the highest recorded cost of this stock over the last 5 years. There is no record of it ever reaching any higher than the amount I originally purchased it for so how is that possible?


To be more specific, the stock chart shows it's peak at $28.04 back in May ...
BUT my purchase price back in October 2018 was over $44. 
Then it was $39 in November, $36 in December, and $33 in January.
And then, there was even a cancelled purchase (thank god) for $51.25 (!!) in May of this year.

Again, how is any of this possible?? What am I missing here? Is Robinhood just ripping me off? Because I dont understand how this is possible if the stock never even reached those prices. 

Please someone enlighten me?

Elsewhere, Cidara jumped on Tuesday after announcing a commercialization deal with Mundipharma that will provide an upfront payment of $30 million and equity investment of $9 million in return for exclusive rights to develop and commercialize rezafungin in all markets outside of the United States and Japan.

# **Stocks look to reclaim their all-time highs in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/06/stocks-look-to-reclaim-their-all-time-highs-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks will look to build on their strong recent momentum and reclaim their record highs next week amid a slew of economic data while trade war fears decrease.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is about 1.6% from an intraday record reached on July 26 after notching back-to-back weekly gains. The broad index is up 1.8% this past week after surging 2.8% in the last week of August.
*****
&gt; Wall Street’s move toward all-time highs comes as recent U.S. economic data suggests a recession may not be in the cards, and the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates later this month. Easing fears around the U.S.-China trade war are also lifting investor sentiment. If the data remains solid, Fed rate cut expectations stay high and U.S.-China trade tensions lower, the market could climb back to all-time highs.
*****
&gt; “You cannot sell the market ahead of the Fed and you cannot sell the market ahead of the trade talks in October,” Steve Grasso, director of institutional sales at Stuart Frankel and a CNBC contributor, told “Power Lunch.” “For now, it’s a bull run.”
*****
&gt; The U.S. services sector grew at a faster rate than expected in August, the Institute for Supply Management said Thursday. The data offset worries from the manufacturing sector. The ISM said Tuesday that the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted for the first time since early 2016.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, the Labor Department on Friday reported better-than-expected U.S. wage growth for August at a time when consumer spending is strong. However, the report also showed jobs growth slowed for a third straight month.
*****
&gt; “The U.S. economy should avoid recession,” Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, wrote in a note. “With slower, but still-solid job gains and good wage growth, households will continue to spend; consumer spending accounts for almost 70 percent of the U.S. economy.”
*****
&gt; Investors will get more information on the state of the consumer next Friday with the release of August retail sales and a preliminary look at September consumer sentiment. Positive data on that front could lift stocks to their records.
*****
&gt; Next week will be important as investors get more clues about the Federal Reserve’s next policy move. August readings for the producer and consumer price indexes are scheduled for release Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
*****
&gt; The Fed has cited persistently low inflation as one of the reasons for easing monetary policy in the U.S. In July, the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points. Market expectations for another quarter-point rate trim in September are at 93.5%, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
&gt; However, stronger-than-expected inflation could raise questions about whether the Fed will reduce rates later this month.
*****
&gt; “Anything that is speaking directly to inflation is going to be most important” for the market, said James Masserio, co-head of equities in the Americas at Societe Generale. “That’s going to be weighted most heavily in the central bank’s monetary policy decision-making process.”
*****
&gt; “Right now, all asset classes are being greatly influenced by the expectations of changes in monetary policy,” Masserio said.
*****
&gt; The Fed is not slated to meet until the week of Sept. 17, but the European Central Bank will announce its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday. The ECB is largely expected to cut rates with some experts forecasting a restart to its quantitative easing program.
*****
&gt; News around U.S.-China trade talks will continue to play a role in the market next week as investors look for signs of progress in the negotiations. On Thursday, China’s Ministry of Commerce said Chinese trade officials will meet their U.S. counterparts in Washington next month.
*****
&gt; “If there’s a bit more optimism around trade, I think we could get back to those previous highs,” said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. “We’re not far from the previous highs. It wouldn’t take much to get there.”

# Meager “Worst Months” Gains Still the Norm in Pre-Election Years

&gt; With a little more than four months of DJIA’s and S&amp;P 500 “Worst Six Months” already completed, the markets performance thus far has been lackluster and in line with historical averages. NASDAQ’s “Worst Four Months” (July through October) has been similar to DJIA and S&amp;P 500. From the close on April 30 through yesterday’s close, DJIA gained just 0.51%, S&amp;P 500 1.02%. From the end of June NASDAQ has gained 1.38%.

&gt; These are rather slim returns for the amount of time. And this excludes the volatility the market experienced in May and again in August. At their respective lows during late May and early June DJIA and S&amp;P 500 were down over 6%. At the August low, NASDAQ was off nearly 3.5%. Our Seasonal Switching Strategy exited DJIA and S&amp;P 500 positions on May 2 and rotated into bond positions. Those bond positions were up an average of 10.1%, excluding dividends on September 4.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 9/6/19

&gt; Despite a shortened week from the Labor Day holiday, there was a heavy slate of economic data with a total of 30 releases. Half of these came in better than estimates or the prior period's reading while another 13 missed or weakened. Three indicators were in line with estimates. There was a lot of manufacturing data this week including readings from Markit and the ISM, Factory Orders, Durable Goods, and Capital Goods. The ISM reading was the most strikingly negative of these as it showed a contractionary reading. The ISM and Markit service counterparts, on the other hand, showed healthier levels, but the Markit PMI did miss estimates. Labor data also was a major focus this week and the overall results were pretty mixed. ISM employment, initial jobless claims, and today's NFP report all disappointed, but the ADP employment change, continuing claims, and labor force participation rate came in stronger than expected. Similarly, each indicator for wages including quarterly unit labor costs and average earnings showed improvements.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090619-Eco.png))**

&gt; It will be slightly less busy next week with only 24 releases scheduled. Following up on this week's labor data, the JOLTS report is due out Tuesday morning and is expected to show fewer job openings than June. Inflation indicators like PPI, CPI, and export and import prices make up a considerable portion of next week's data. Core estimates for both PPI and CPI are forecasted to show higher price inflation in August. In addition to preliminary consumer sentiment, on Friday we will also get a reading on retail sales for August. For both core and headline readings, this indicator is expected to slow significantly MoM compared to July.

# Economic Surprise Index Turns Positive

&gt; When it comes to economic reports, one trend that has seemingly been in place all year is that the vast majority of data points have come in short of expectations. The fact that economic momentum has been slowing is one thing, but when the economy consistently comes up short relative to expectations, it sets a tone that things are quickly deteriorating. That's never a good thing, but thankfully, there are signs that the tide is turning.

&gt; The Citi Economic Surprise Index measures the pace at which economic indicators are coming in ahead of or below consensus forecasts. When the index is negative, it means that the majority of reports are coming in below expectations, while a positive reading indicates that most data is coming in ahead of expectations. The chart below shows the index going back to 2003, and the parts where the line is red indicate periods where the index was negative for at least 100 trading days. The most recent period of negative readings was one of the longest ever at 140 trading days and just the 6th streak of 100 or more trading days (during the period from 2015 to 2016 there were actually two separate streaks although it looks like just one long streak in the chart). The fact that this index is now positive indicates that economists have finally ratcheted down estimates enough to be in line with actual conditions on the ground.

# Sentiment Back to Normal

&gt; Bullish investor sentiment as measured by AAII's sentiment survey rose 2.5 percentage points to 28.64% this week. While this is an improvement, bullish sentiment is still in the 18th percentile of the data over the past decade. We must also note that the survey would not have captured any benefit from today's news on the trade front and the technical breakout of stocks and other assets like crude oil. Save a tweet or a headline reversing what appears to be optimism given today's positive price action, we'll likely see a bigger jump in bullish sentiment next week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090519-AAII-Bullish.png))**

&gt; Bulls borrowed from the bears this week as bearish sentiment fell from 42.2% last week to 39.5%. As with bullish sentiment, this is not necessarily a dramatic improvement as it is still higher than 83% of weeks over the past 10 years. Bearish sentiment also remains the predominant sentiment level among investors as the bull-bear spread is still fairly wide at -10.87 percentage points. Granted, that is the narrowest spread since the last week of July when it was only 28 bps in favor of bears.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090519-AAII-Bearish.png))**

&gt; The bulk of the loss in bearish sentiment went to bulls, but a small portion also went to the neutral camp as the percentage of investors reporting as neutral grew to 31.9%. While bullish sentiment is still several percentage points below its historical average and the opposite applying to bearish sentiment, neutral sentiment has been pulling back to its historical average over the past few months. Where it currently sits at 31.9%, it is only 0.33% from that average.

# ISM Services Shows Little Pressure in Inflation

&gt; Following Tuesday's ISM Manufacturing report, we noted the extremely low reading in the monthly ISM Commodities Survey, which measures the number of commodities rising and falling in price. After today's report for the Non-Manufacturing sector, that trend remained in place. In this morning's report, respondents noted price increases in just 6 commodities and decreases in 4. That net reading of +2 is the weakest reading since January. Combining the results of both reports, in August we saw a total of just 8 commodities up in price and 15 lower. That reading of negative 7 was the lowest since February 2016, while the three-month moving average of -4.0 was the lowest since April 2016.

&gt; As we noted on Tuesday, low readings in the commodities survey usually track the direction of inflation readings pretty closely and would imply that the current y/y reading of 1.8% in CPI will see downward pressure in the months ahead. For example, in the eight prior months where the three-month moving average in the combined reading was between zero and negative five, the average y/y reading in CPI was +0.45% while the median level was +0.65%.

# Low P/E, Low Return

&gt; Most investors are trying to forget about August performance as quickly as possible, but we wanted to highlight a noteworthy data set about the month before it gets too far into the rear-view mirror. At the end of every month, we run our decile analysis of the S&amp;P 500 to see which stock characteristics drove performance the most. One characteristic we look at is valuation, and in August, valuations played a big role in performance.

&gt; Below we've broken up the S&amp;P 500 into deciles based on P/E ratios (trailing 12-month). Decile 1 contains the 50 stocks in the S&amp;P with the lowest P/Es at the start of August, while decile 10 contains the 50 stocks in the index with the highest (or negative) P/Es. Each bar in the chart shows the average percentage change in August of the 50 stocks in each decile.

&gt; As shown, the 50 stocks in the S&amp;P with the lowest P/E ratios at the start of the month fell an average of 11.5% in August! The next two deciles with the lowest P/E ratios fell more than 5% as well. On the other end of the spectrum, the 50 stocks with the highest P/E ratios fell only 0.78% in August.

&gt; You've certainly heard a lot about the ""death of value investing"" recently, and this is why! We have to think that at some point the scales will tip and head in the other direction.

# Down August, Up YTD, No Worries

&gt; Now that the very volatile month of August has finished on the downside folks are concerned about the other worst month, September, and for good reason. Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year. However, while August was negative this year with the market still up year-to-date the prospects for Q4 and the year as a whole are not so ominous. In fact, it’s kind of bullish.

&gt; Early last month we relayed the historical data on August declines being quite commonplace though overall, years with August declines were quite choppy and not especially bullish. However when the market was up year-to-date at the end of August despite an August decline the picture changes dramatically. In the tables here you can see that after some extended volatility and negativity in September Q4 and the year as a whole has been rather positive.

&gt; Since 1949 in years the market was up YTD in August but down for the month DJIA was up in September 56.3% of the time (9 of 16) with an average gain of 0.76%, up in Q4 81.3% of the time (13 of 16) with an average gain of 5.68% and up for the year 100% of the time with an average gain of 17.43%.

&gt; The S&amp;P has a similar record up 58.8% of the time in September (10 of 17) with an average gain of 0.81%, up in Q4 94.1% of the time with an average gain of 5.73% and up for the year 100% of the time with an average gain of 20.21%.

&gt; Since 1971 NASDAQ was up in September 66.7% of the time (6 of 9) with an average gain of 0.35%, up in Q4 66.7% of the time (6 of 9) with an average gain of 4.04% and up for the year 100% of the time with an average gain of 21.72%. NASDAQ was hit much harder in the 1983 bear market and 1997 Asian Financial Crisis than the much larger cap (at the time) DJIA and S&amp;P.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.","Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 9th, 2019"
stocks,"I got interested in [Dominion Energy (D)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/D?p=D&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch) because they are an utility company which has been around since 1983, the dividend is great (currently 4.74%) and they have some amount of solar power. I thought that because they have been around for so long, they must know what they are doing.

I was surprised when the stock recently took a huge dip, because their income is apparently diminishing. I also found out that their payout ratio is over 233% according to Google Finance, meaning they pay over twice as much in dividend as the profit they are generating.

My questions are:
1. How did they get into a position where their income is diminishing? It seems that should almost never happen to a utility.
2. The payout ratio seems highly unsustainable. Is there any way for them out of this? Again, how did they get in this position? It seems incredibly stupid.
3. Which would you rather invest in, between D, AQN (Algonquin Power) and NPI (Northland Power)? Are AQN and NPI safer bets?",What's up with Dominion Energy's insane payout ratio and diminishing profits?

stocks,"A lot of people have talked on this subreddit recently that Berkshire Hathaway is currently sitting on $100B+ in cash. People interpret that as Berkshire essentially waiting for equities to lessen in value before they deploy their capital. 

I don’t believe that. I think they’re growing their cash position as a way to allow Warren and Munger to make one more large acquisition before they transition out of leadership roles.

Buffett did mention they attempted a “major” acquisition earlier this year though it failed at the last second. Buffett went on to explain that moves like the one he referred to are what keeps his heart still beating. 

TL;DR - I would not be surprised if in the next 12 months Berkshire makes a massive acquisition, utilizing the large part of the cash they’re currently sitting on.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

You might think UGI sounds like a boring, stodgy company. And management would be fine with that. It doesn’t want to be in the headlines like Apple or Facebook. In the utility space, that’s par for the course.

But UGI is far from your typical ho-hum business. Since 2000, its stock has rocketed from just a little over $4 to a peak of $57.45 last year. Even though it’s pulled back a bit in 2019, it’s been quietly outperforming the market for years",UGI - A safe stock

I am sorry if this is a basic question to some, but it is one that still stumps me, and I have been unable to find an answer to. 

How do investors find out a companies earnings before the company reportedly is going to release them?

For instance today, $LULU was scheduled to release Q2 at 4:30pm. I was in a meeting until 4:15, and by the time I checked the stocked, and thought I was going to be ready to hear the earnings on the conference call, the stock already spiked and sold down. There were articles written 10 minutes past 4 with all the information. How did all of these people find out the earnings if Lululemon was set to report them at 4:30?

&gt; ***Hi r/stocks! I am just putting out next week's most anticipated earnings calendar a day earlier than usual due to not being able to get around to do this tomorrow or this weekend. I really don't like to post these up any earlier than Friday's because sometimes the calendars can look a bit wonky where you might see some companies on the calendar that are actually not scheduled to report, or are reporting on another day, etc etc. but unfortunately I don't really have much of an option here...it's either putting this up now or no earnings thread at all for next week. Anyway, please do me this favor everyone and review carefully the companies that are scheduled to report on their respective days for next week. Admittedly, I did not get a chance to confirm all the companies that are on this week's calendar are actually reporting, but if you see something that doesn't look right, as far as a company that is listed up on this calendar on a particular day that isn't expected to report, please just post a little notice in this thread so that everyone is made aware of it! I'd greatly appreciate that. It's very possible that there are some company logos on this calendar that are misplaced here. FWIW, I do not create these calendars. These are coming straight from EW (Earnings Whispers). Thank you!***

High dividend yield (~24% per Fidelity)

Argentina's economy is in shambles yet again
The peso is/was losing value
Political turmoil in the country atm

TGS produces and delivers natural gas in Argentina.  From what I've read, it's the country's leading company in this field.  So it seems stable.  What has me on the fence with pulling the trigger on a buy is the polictical/economic uncertainty.  Argentina's market has been in and out of recessions for several years now, and I haven't found any clear cut news articles on how long they have been in their current one.  So I can't gauge if a turnaround is likely yet or not.

There is also no way to tell how thier upcoming election will play out.  The current president lost a primary election by a landslide which sent the market to the floor, taking $TGS with it.  The election is this October, so there is still time for the market to swing as it will over there.

I also don't know how a recession or full on Argentinian default would really effect a company like TGS.  In one of the news articles I read a family was interviewed on how they're adjusting to the overall downfall in the economy.  One lady said she switched her car to run on natural gas instead of petrol to save money.  If this is a common thing going on right now over there, then TGS is going to continue making money in these rough times.  

I've watched it fall down to $7.12 USD/share a few days ago all the way up to $8.22 at close today.  I'm going to keep an eye on it for the next week or so and see if it stays on the rise or drops back down again.

stocks,"The growing negative sentiment around Uber stock is surprising to me.  Not only do I envision Uber breaking even sooner than expected, my thoughts trend toward Uber profiting massively after scaling the divisions that eventually become profitable and trimming those that do not.  Specifically, I am referring to Uber ride sharing, Uber Eats, and Uber Freight.  

Uber ride sharing – yes, this division isn’t currently profitable but let’s do the math. With over 91 million active riders and 14 million trips per day, gradual price increases or take rates will result in profit.  For example, raising rides by $1 would equate to:  $1 x 14,000,000 x 365 = $5.1 Billion dollars in additional profit.  That’s right, $5 Billion with a capital B.  In addition, Uber could up-sell each trip with in-ride entertainment, in-ride advertisements, optional city tours for travelers, show reservations, etc.  With 14 million active riders per day, small and gradual adjustments could make a huge impact to the bottom line.

Uber Eats and Uber Freight fall into the company’s “Other Bets” segment.  Their S-1 filing explains “""Other Bets revenue increased to $373 million in 2018 compared to $67 million in 2017. This increase was primarily related to the expansion of our Uber Freight offering,"" reads the filing. “

In 2018, Uber generated $1.46 billion from Uber Eats, up 148.7% from the previous year. Uber Eats now makes up 17.3% of Uber's overall revenue. The company's gross bookings from Uber Eats grew 108% YoY to $3.07 billion.

An Oppenheimer &amp; Co. research note projected that Uber Freight would capture 6.1% of the U.S. truck brokerage market by 2029, generating around $12 billion in gross revenue in a market estimated to be worth $117 billion.

The growth rate for both Uber Eats and Uber Freight is impressive.  It’s clear that Uber is heavily investing in both to acquire market share and expand.  It will take time and it will cost money.  Just like with Uber ride sharing, gradual adjustments in prices, take rates, up-sell opportunities, and increasing operating efficiency will result in profit. 

I skipped the whole autonomous vehicle idea deliberately as it is not relevant.  Uber doesn’t need autonomous vehicles to become profitable.  Taxis have been profitable for decades.  Freight companies have been profitable for decades. Medical transportation companies have been profitable for decades (similar to Uber Health).  

Uber is growing to acquire market share.  As the dials turn behind the scenes according to Dara Khosrowshahi’s leadership, the company will become profitable. That will only be the beginning of the transportation revolution.

I welcome your thoughts.",How UBER can become profitable - Am I missing something?

stocks,"There have been numerous articles now that have spread the idea that $TLRD is doomed because of workplace casual. Some examples:

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/tailored-brands-stock-suits-casual-51553200454](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tailored-brands-stock-suits-casual-51553200454)

It's a compelling narrative so long -- as one does not check the numbers. YTD, $TLRD's stock has dropped a whopping 60.8% compared to the retail sector's -8.81%.

But as you may know, Michael Burry recently assumed an activist position in $TLRD: [http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=13622252&amp;RcvdDate=8/30/2019&amp;CoName=TAILORED%20BRANDS%20INC&amp;FormType=SC%2013D&amp;View=html](http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=13622252&amp;RcvdDate=8/30/2019&amp;CoName=TAILORED%20BRANDS%20INC&amp;FormType=SC%2013D&amp;View=html). So what gives?

\- Suits and tuxedos are not going away. There will always be weddings, funerals, lawyers, proms, various black tie events, etc. Much has been made of the workplace casual trend. So the question is, how much demand did the workplace drive relative to these other uses for suits? Perhaps not as much as people think. Check out TLRD's numbers. Retail sales held steady, and retail gross margins increased from 2016-2018, against the backdrop of increasing workplace casual. In fact, the trend towards workplace casual has been alive about a decade now, yet MW saw growth throughout much of the decade. So are fluctuations in sales numbers really driven by the workplace casual trend, or are there other more dominant factors? (An SA article came out recently w/ these numbers.)

\- Once you believe that demand for formalwear is here to stay. Then you realize that the trend in TLRD's stock price is very overblown. It's trading like demand for suits is going to drop off a cliff and therefore TLRD is going bankrupt. However, the reality is that TLRD is a cash flow machine. Despite taking on stupid debt to acquire JoS A Bank a few years ago, they have still been able to pay it down at a safe rate, and their 2022 debt is trading at or above par.

\- Once you believe TLRD is not going bankrupt in the near future, then you can start to value it rationally using normal measures for valuation. For example, one DCF valuation I saw assumed declining sales for the next decade, and still had TLRD valued at \~$11.

\- Long term, once they've brought down their debt to a reasonable level, they will be able to invest that big cash flow into expansion once again.",$TLRD: the bear case is weaker than you think

But that turn is not near sharp enough for the FDA, which has issued a second complete response letter (CRL) for the Lantus competitor Biocon developed with Mylan. 

Biocon announced over the weekend that the FDA had issued the CRL to Mylan for the drug approval “pending completion” of improvements at Biocon’s facilities in Malaysia. It was not a big surprise given that the FDA tallied a dozen issues at the three facilities that comprise the manufacturing operation for the drug during a preapproval inspection in June.

“The CRL did not identify any outstanding scientific issues with the application,” Biocon said (PDF) in a public filing. “We remain confident of the quality of our application and do not anticipate any impact of this CRL on the commercial launch timing of our Insulin Glargine in the U.S.”

RELATED: No surprise: FDA hits Mylan and Biocon with CRL for their follow-on copy of Lantus

The whole episode is deja vu for Biocon and Mylan, which received a CRL for the product in June 2018 following an earlier preapproval inspection. In that case, the FDA asked for additional clinical data to support a request to manufacture the insulin injectors at the Malaysia facility instead of at a plant in Bangalore, India, that has had its own issues. 

Biocon and Mylan have won approval of their drug, branded Semglee, in Europe and already launched it in England, but it competes in those markets with copies from Eli Lilly and Merck &amp; Co. 

While the further U.S. delay is a setback for Biocon and Mylan, it doesn’t mean much for Sanofi. That’s because sales of the French drugmaker’s top-selling drug have already been badly eroded by significant price discounting and by competition from Basaglar, the Lantus biosimilar Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim launched in the U.S. in 2016.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

stocks,"First of all, i’m a newbie in the market but i’ve spent money in the market because it’s better than keeping them in the bank (at least so far). Most of my money are in mutual funds. 

I have 4 stocks that i bought a few months ago: GOOG, FB, AMZN and TSLA (call me a basic bitch if you want). Currently i have a decent profit on GOOG (+9.7%) and TSLA (7.8%), small profit on FB (2.4%) and a small loss on AMZN (1.8%).  Around 4% (so quite a lot) of the gain on most of those stocks are due to my country’s currency falling compared to the dollar. In local currency i’m actually down at FB for example. 

Right now the dollar is higher than ever. My country’s economy isn’t doing bad apparently and it is quite stable, but from what i’ve read the currency is getting lower because of «nervous investors who’s afraid of the Trump-China relations». I don’t know anything about currencies really but i don’t think it’s ever been a higher ratio compared to the Euro and the Dollar, so i don’t think the ratio will increase much more. 

I’m considering selling some of my stocks because i’m a bit afraid of a recession, and i’m wondering if i should sell now because the currency rate is so high. Could that be a valid reason to sell? I’ve watched quite a few stock lessons and videos to learn about the basics but i’ve never heard anyone talk about selling stocks because of currency rates really, so that’s why i’m wondering. 

On TipRanks, AMZN, FB and GOOG are still all strong buys though, and most sites still seem to have upside ratings, so that’s mostly what’s keeping me from selling at the moment, considering i don’t have enough knowledge to read balance sheets and stuff well yet. 

And which of the stocks are most recession proof? I’m thinking FB and GOOG, while TSLA is more of a spec stock and AMZN has a high PE so it’s probably not as safe as the two first.

Should i sell some stock, and if so, which stock(s) would you sell?",Should i consider selling my US stocks because of currency rates?

Technical analysis &amp; commentary:

The S&amp;P 500 is setting up perfectly for a crash on Oct 31 when the U.K. hard Brexits. The chart shows a clean technical trend towards an inflection point on that day—a strange coincidence. Here is some (hopefully) simple (enough) analysis to help you understand the risk of this particular scenario.

Looking at the chart with a daily timeframe (Chart #1), the medium term trend for the market is making a megaphone pattern (dark green lines). It looks like this &lt; on the chart but is pointing to 10 p.m. on the chart instead of 9 p.m. This is a bearish trend that shows limited upside (top dark green line is flattish) with increasing volatility (cone of the megaphone is expanding) to the downside (bottom dark green line is steeper than top line).

The short term trend is making a flag pattern (light green lines). It looks like this &gt; on the chart but is pointing to 2 p.m. on the chart instead of 3 p.m. This is a bullish trend showing a series of higher highs and lower lows. The price has traded very neatly within these trends in the last few weeks.

The trends collide on Oct 4, at which point the price will break-out of one trend and confirm the other. As we count down to Brexit, I think the market will trade throughout Oct between 3000-3150, above the dark green top line and into the end of the light green flag pattern. But it will be a bull-trap. The reality of hard Brexit may be the catalyst that confirms the megaphone pattern.

This prediction is supported by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator (Chart #1; second graph with intertwined blue and orange lines). MACD on the daily timeframe is beneath zero, indicating downward momentum, but that momentum is becoming less negative (shown by the cyclical uptick towards zero).

The Relative Strength Index (third graph with purple line) is currently at 68 on the daily timeframe, short of the 80 mark which usually triggers selling. Both of these indicators suggest the market has one last little heave to give towards the 3150 level before it stalls and crashes.

Looking at the chart with the monthly timeframe (Chart #2), we see the correlation between the unemployment rate (orange line) and recessions. Weakening employment conditions are the final indicator before a crash as it shows recessionary effects have passed from manufacturing through the whole economy to workers and consumers. Historically, a 0.3%+ increase in the three month moving average (MA) of the unemployment rate (not shown in charts) has signalled a recession is imminent. The jobs number is reported the first Friday of every month. The unemployment 3m MA has ticked up in the last couple months and will likely reach 3.9%, the critical level (3.6% low plus 0.3%)...in Oct. The RSI and MACD on the monthly chart also look prime to turn negative. So the stars are aligning for Oct 31.

If the market crashes, there are no established technical price levels where we can expect support (shown by horizontal red lines on Chart #1; support is when there is more buying than selling, which drives the price up) until 2350, a level last reached in the Dec 2018 tremor that shook global markets. Interestingly, the megaphone pattern indicates the next low will be 2100 on Feb 14 2020; 2100 is the next technical price level with support. Below 2100 the next major support is 1800, which would represent a 40% decline from 3250, but losses could run deeper.

If this set up comes about, it represents a huge trading opportunity. I'd recommend at the money puts on the SPXL (3x leveraged S&amp;P) with 20-40 day expiry. If this all comes to pass, a safe entry price will be when the price crosses the 200 day moving average (blue line on Chart #1, first graph). By safe I mean relatively safe; trading options on a leveraged index is for professionals and requires proper due diligence.",[TA] S&amp;P 500 is showing a technically clean set-up for a major shorting opportunity at 3150 around Oct 31 hard Brexit

Anyways, I was wondering why Trade Ideas float for tickers differ quiet often when compared to finviz and yahoo? The reason I'm asking is because since I'm paying for TI, I was assuming their information was correct over free information such as yahoo and finviz (not entirely true at all as you can see). How often does Trade Ideas update their database regarding ticker information? Since I've realized the difference, about 50% of the ticker's float from TI differ when compared to Yahoo / Finviz.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 2nd, 2019.

# **Investors say goodbye to choppy August markets but September may be no better  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/30/investors-through-choppy-august-markets-but-september-may-be-no-better.html)**
*****
&gt; Stock market investors may be glad to see August go, but September might not be any better, unless there are some positive developments in the trade war.
*****
&gt; Markets enter September, anticipating a Federal Reserve rate cut mid-month and worrying the chilling in the global economy will reach the U.S. There appears to be no progress in the trade war between the U.S. and China, and investors are watching to see if it will begin to hit key data.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell about 2% for the month, its worst performance since May. August was a month of rising recession worries and trade headlines moved the market in both directions, starting with the Aug. 1 declaration by President Donald Trump that he would put tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods.
*****
&gt; “If history repeats itself we could see a selloff in September and then we have some sort of capitulation,” said Samuel Stovall, chief market strategist CFRA. “We’re in the midst of what I call a pullback. The line in the sand is really 2,800. If we break meaningfully through that we could end up having a sharp and swift decline.”
*****
&gt; The first week of September includes some important reports, including the August employment report on Friday and the ISM manufacturing survey on Tuesday. The auto industry releases monthly vehicle sales Wednesday. Investors will also be looking for news on whether face-to-face negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials can take place in September, as expected after the last round of talks.
*****
&gt; For the stock market, September is historically a worse month than August, in terms of losses. “If you thought August was bad, history says September can be worse because not only is it the month with the largest average decline, but is the only month to fall more frequently than it rises,” said Stovall.
*****
&gt; Since World War II, the average move for the S&amp;P for all months is a gain of 0.69%, but the average September move is negative 0.54%. The market has been down 55% of the time in September, making it the worst month of the year, but October, which is up 61% of the time, is a more volatile month with historically steeper losses.
*****
&gt; Stock investors will also be watching interest rates, which have been in a steep decline in August. In one month, the 30-year bond has lost 60 basis points, to a level under 2%. The widely watched yield curve, between the 2-year Treasury yield and the 10-year yield inverted. That is a recession warning and means the 10-year yield has gotten lower than the 2-year yield, or investors are demanding more yield for shorter term investments.
*****
&gt; Investors will be watching to see how the incoming data affects the bond market and most importantly, the Fed. The Fed meets Sept. 17 and 18, and it is expected to cut rates by a quarter point though some bond strategists say it could cut by a half percentage point if the economy softens or markets are highly volatile.
*****
&gt; Next week could provide some clues on future monetary policy with Chairman Jerome Powell set to speak next Friday at 12:30 p.m. ET. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman is also set to speak Wednesday at 12:30 p.m. ET.
*****
&gt; “Without offering judgment on Powell’s performance heretofore, investors will be seeking clarity on if 2019 will mirror the 1990s (75 bp of aggregate rate cuts) or if the fallout from the trade war has done more damage to the global economy and therefore warrants even greater accommodation,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, in a note.
*****
&gt; Economists expect 155,000 jobs were added in August, down from 164,000 in July, according to Refinitiv. They expect the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.7% and average hourly earnings to rise by 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said he is watching the ADP private sector payroll report Thursday, ahead of the government’s report Friday, since it includes details on small business hiring. The sector has shown weakness in the ADP data.
*****
&gt; “May and June showed declines. That was the only time since 2010 that ADP showed declines for small employers over the course of the recovery. July was really weak too,” he said. Tilley said it’s unclear why that sector of the job market is showing softening, but since it is the first time since the recovery, it bears watching.
*****
&gt; Tilley said job growth appears to be at its weakest of the cycle. The government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics recently revised its job data to show 501,000 fewer jobs from March 2018 to March 2019. Tilley said he looked at the adjustment by spreading the reductions over the period, and it shows job growth was reduced by 41,750 in each of those months.
*****
&gt; “It means job growth was never as strong in 2018 as we thought, and the slowness is of concern,” he said. “On the other hand, if total wages and total GDP are unchanged, then the slower job growth came with higher average wages and higher productivity than previously thought.”
*****
&gt; The strength of the labor market is key, since it’s been helping fuel the consumer, responsible for about two-thirds of the economy.
*****
&gt; “If you’re looking for the recovery to keep going, and if you’re looking at this to be pushing it and consumer spending, this would be a red flag,” he said.
*****
&gt; Tilley said he is also watching the ISM manufacturing survey, particularly after Markit PMI data, another series of manufacturing data, showed a contraction. ISM is expected at 51.4, up slightly from 51.2 last month. A reading above 50 shows expansion.

# Day after Labor Day Bullish for Small Caps

&gt; In the last 21 years, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have all registered average gains of exceeding 0.2% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have been up five of the last seven years, but DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all declined on the day in 2017 and 2018. On Wednesday the market’s performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 0.12%. S&amp;P 500 is worst, up only 38.1% of the time with an average loss of 0.005%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/66d0e165de0d5099b7b8b4f3ad896b90/99822dfcc2c80238-01/s500x750/4f9276207bcd30da1ad67856d0ef0a5a08d48b3b.jpg))**

# Typical September Trading: Choppy Early Gains Fade Late

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/59d316c9fcecc63780352f570022c024/502fb4ed37d42dd3-a1/s500x750/c3d1c6969f2f4deb7ac0e36e54cd6643dc73f2ec.jpg))**

&gt; September is the final month of the third quarter and historically it is essentially tied with August as worst month of the year. Since 1950, September is ranked last for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Small-caps, measured by the Russell 1000, have fared slightly better, but historical average performance is still negative. Over the last 21 years, September has generally opened tepidly with mixed performance depending on index with Russell 2000 often rising the most through mid-month. However, after mid-month gains have tended to fade quickly and turn into losses by month’s end. Sizable losses in 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2011 weigh heavily on average performance.

# Down Friday/Down Monday Levels Not Reclaimed Yet

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3e4c044d3d67395aa8ed45109ab5394f/dacebc880c3c9347-ff/s500x750/d19682be7ae94930d29057dffb20f87f0af34de7.jpg))**

&gt; Technically speaking, the market has settled into a range between 2815 and 2945 on the S&amp;P 500. S&amp;P 2815 is a support level we have been tracking for some time now that sits at the intraday high back on November 7, 2018 where the market failed last fall before the 20% correction ran its course to the Christmas Eve low. The good news is the 2815 has held here this time unlike the ~2700 level last fall. 

&gt; The bad news or at least the technical case for no new highs is that the S&amp;P has yet to clear the 2945 level, which was the intraday high on Friday August 2 that was the beginning of two back-to-back Down Friday/Down Mondays, which has a negative indication if not quickly reclaimed.

&gt; Fund Flows Still Feeble

&gt; Below is an update of fund flows data from the Investment Company Institute including mutual funds and ETFs. In the tables below, we show dollar fund flows for total mutual funds plus ETFs along with ETFs alone. Obviously, mutual fund flows have been persistently negative for a long time now, but ETF flows are making up for that in many ways. The combined data only goes back to 2013, but over that period total ETF flows are in the 99th percentile for all ETFs...and that includes a string of drawdowns in domestic equity ETF flows over the last few weeks. Combined, ETF plus mutual fund flows are a better measure of total sentiment than mutual funds alone. While ETF fund inflows are only just off record highs, combined mutual fund and ETF fund flows are down across the past week, month, three months, and year for all equity funds, domestic only equity funds, and global equity funds. On the other hand, bond funds have seen the same torrid inflows that have been picked up in mutual fund flows for a long time now: since 2013, total bond inflows to ETFs are near the 97th percentile for all periods. For ETFs plus mutual funds, recent inflows are less dramatic but still very, very large; that’s especially true for the municipal bond space. We also note commodity funds have seen a pickup in net flows of late.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/083019-Flows.png))**

&gt; To provide further context, below we show rolling 13 week fund flows for the total equity space as well as domestic funds only. While ETFs have seen material inflows, combined mutual and ETF flows are still materially negative, with total equity mutual fund plus ETF flows at a record size.

&gt; B.I.G. Tips - Years Like 2019: August Edition

&gt; We’ve highlighted the chart below comparing 2019 to 1998 a number of times over the last several weeks, and the similarities between the performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each year has continued right up through the end of August. While the pullback from the highs this Summer hasn’t been as severe as it was in 1998, the timing of both and the subsequent periods of backing and filling has been striking. A continuation of the similar patters certainly wouldn’t be a positive in the short term, but the silver lining is that Q4 1998 was exceptionally strong.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chartwebsite1998.png))**

&gt; As we do throughout the year, in our most recent B.I.G. Tips report we compared the S&amp;P 500's trading pattern this year to all other years in order to see which ones were the most similar. With those similar years, we then analyzed how the S&amp;P 500 performed for the remainder of the year in order to help come up with a framework for what to expect for the rest of this year. It shouldn't surprise anyone that 1998 made the list, but a number of other notable years also had strong similarities to the pattern of 1998 with very different outcomes as well.

&gt; Russell 2000 (IWM) Testing Support

&gt; Unlike large-cap major indices like the Dow or S&amp;P 500 which managed to reach record highs earlier this year, so far in 2019, the small-cap focused Russell 2000 never managed to so much as retest the highs from around this time last year. In fact, in the past year, other than the final leg down to December lows and the subsequent rally back up to previous levels in early 2019, the Russell has been in a range between support and resistance from last fall. This support and resistance can actually be traced back even further to the highs and lows of late 2017 and early 2018. This year has seen more tests of these support levels after May declines and once again this month.

&gt; At the beginning of August, the Russell collapsed through flat 50 and 200-DMAs finding relief at the bottom of this range. Since then, the index has been bouncing between this support and the 200-day with the most recent failed test of its 200-DMA coming just last week. Over the past few sessions, while it has not closed significantly below, intraday the index has breached these critical support levels. Fortunately, today the index is seeing some mean reversion from its extreme oversold levels as it is up rather than breaking out of the range to the downside.

# What's Driven the S&amp;P 500?

&gt; In last night's Closer, we showed the biggest contributors to the S&amp;P 500's gain so far in 2019 as well as the stocks that have weighed on the index the most. Given the S&amp;P's 14% YTD gain, it's probably not surprising to hear that only one stock in the entire S&amp;P 500 has weighed on the total index performance by at least 20 bps: Pfizer (PFE). On the other hand, 11 different stocks have added at least 20 bps to total index performance in 2019. We show the 10 best and worst-performing stocks this year by the overall contribution to the S&amp;P 500's performance in the table below. As shown, mega-cap Tech like Microsoft (MSFT) and four of the five FAANG names have been the biggest contributors. When you add them all up, they've accounted for roughly 26% of the S&amp;P's gain this year. Two credit card companies -- Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V), and two retailers -- Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) -- have also been big contributors to gains.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082819-Drive1.png))**

&gt; At the industry group level, health care stocks related to Pharmaceuticals, Biotech, and Life Sciences are one of only two industry groups to weigh on S&amp;P 500 performance this year. Energy is the other standout with a 4% decline. Software &amp; Services is the best performer, driving 3.3 percentage points of the S&amp;P's 14% gain this year. Media &amp; Entertainment, Retail which includes Amazon (AMZN), and tech Hardware are the only other groups that have added at least 1% to the total 14.46% gain for the S&amp;P 500 so far in 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082819-Drive2.png))**

&gt; While YTD numbers look really great, things are not so hot versus this time last year; the S&amp;P 500 is actually slightly lower year-over-year. As a result, the gap between the contribution of gainers and those of decliners is much narrower. Only four stocks drove a gain of at least 20 bps for the headline index over the past year: Microsoft (MSFT), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and Visa (V).

&gt; We note that the top ten gainers are almost exclusively very blue-chip stocks: large tech companies, credit card networks, and some consumer names. Only the cell phone tower REIT American Tower (AMT) is unusual in this list of big-cap, well-known stocks. Losers are concentrated in Health Care, Banks, and Tech.

&gt; While Alphabet (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) aren't down drastically versus last summer, their market caps are big enough to have cost a lot of performance for the S&amp;P 500's overall performance. Smaller cap stocks like NVIDIA (NVDA), DuPont (DD), AbbVie (ABBV), and Schlumberger (SLB) are a verry different story.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082819-Drive3.png))**

&gt; At the industry group level, there have been more decliners than gainers, though only Energy and Banks have cost the index more than 80 bps; on the flip side only Software has been a greater than 80 bps gainer. Defensive industry groups like Utilities, Household &amp; Personal Products, and Real Estate have all driven the S&amp;P 500 higher while cyclical industry groups like Capital Goods and Tech Hardware have weighed.

# This Isn't Normal

&gt; Being long bonds these days probably feels like being long tech stocks in the late 1990s. Every day you look at your portfolio, you expect it to be higher than the last time. This month through yesterday, the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year US Treasury Index is up over 10% and that doesn't even include the rally we are seeing today. If the gains we have seen so far hold up into month-end, it will go down as just the 5th month since 1978 that long-term treasuries gained more than 10% in a single month. The last time we saw this large of a move in the long-term Treasury market was more than 10 years ago in November 2008, and before that you have to go all the way back to February 1986. In other words, this kind of move isn't normal.

&gt; Besides the fact that long-term Treasuries are up over 10% this month, August marks the fourth straight month of gains for the asset class, and while that may not sound like much, the last time we saw a streak of four or more months of gains was in January 2015. With all these gains, the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year Treasury Index is up over 22% YTD. 22%!

# Consumer Confidence Defies Pessimism

&gt; U.S. consumers are feeling especially empowered these days, despite growing pessimism about the economic outlook.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Consumer Confidence Pushes Through Trade Uncertainty, the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index fell to 135.1 in August. Still, that’s the fifth-highest reading of the economic cycle, an impressive feat given trade tensions and other global headwinds.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zAlOT8M.jpg))**

&gt; August’s strong consumer confidence reading was driven by a 19-year high in consumers’ views of present economic conditions. That’s no surprise to us, as steady gains in wages and jobs typically support consumer spending. Fiscal stimulus implemented in 2018 provided an extra boost of income through lower tax rates and added tax credits, and lower oil prices have allowed consumers to allot more income to discretionary spending.

&gt; “Consumer spending has been one of the most encouraging trends in the economy lately, thanks to a solid U.S. labor market,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “It’s difficult to see a near-term economic downturn with such a strong undercurrent from the U.S. consumer.”

&gt; A U.S. economy carried by the consumer isn’t a bad situation to be in. After all, consumer spending accounts for about 70% of gross domestic product, so healthy consumer activity could carry the expansion on its own.

&gt; However, U.S. businesses need to transition into leadership at this point in the cycle. As we mentioned in Tuesday’s blog, capital expenditures (capex) need to rebound as the cycle matures to help sustain the expansion. Unfortunately, trade uncertainty has increasingly weighed on corporate sentiment, so a resurgence in capex may not be possible without a U.S.-China trade resolution.

Quote from an interview:

Q: What’s in your portfolio now?

A: One good stroke of good fortune was meeting Warren Buffett in 1968. It led me to realize that I needed to invest in Berkshire Hathaway (ticker: BRK.A), although I didn’t do it until 1982. It’s my single investment in the stock market. It’s like a broad value-stocks equity index. I hold it in lieu of VTSAX [the Vanguard Total Stock Market fund]. It does about as well with no current taxes to pay. VTSAX has dividends that are taxed annually. I also have some hedge funds, but I consider them not as good as Berkshire, so I use them to spend and finance other things I do.

If price was not random, it would be easy to build a trading strategy. Our struggle to tame arbitrariness is the source of all the abstract constructs we put around price.

Fundamental, technical, quantitative, factor analyses are endeavors to tame arbitrariness. 

Fundamental analysis is an endeavor at soothsaying tomorrow’s price by reading into today’s entrails.
Value is the construal we ascribe to valuation.

Technical analysis, categorically the predictive kind such as de Mark, Fibonacci, is an endeavor at bringing divine order to chaos.

Quantitative analysis is the predictably skeptical science of skepticality.

Factor analysis is an endeavor at reverse engineering yesterday’s soup into tomorrow’s menu.

None of those obediences preach acceptance of what is: the arbitrariness of price. They all believe that ineluctably they will be able to tame it, and in doing so, they are the architects of their own frangibility. Keep Christmas trees for December, chaos theory for weather forecast and fundamental bedtime stories for your children.

Underperformers have an external locus of control:

I suppose we can all agree that if you don’t have a trading system, you can’t expect to outperform someone who does.

Now, if you rely on analysts, scam-artists, often referred to as market gurus, experts, signal accommodations and garbage newsletters to tell you what to do, you implicitly adopt their trading system.
Do they call back when it is time to exit or do they hide under the desk? Oops, now you are in trouble. You have delegated your entire trading system, your money making machine, to someone who explicitly relucts to postulate responsibility. And then you wonder why you lose!?!

My fund launched in 2002. Outperformers had an internal locus of control. They were independent ruminators. They make their own decisions and take responsibility for what, when and how much to enter and exit. This is how they developed a credence system that would translate into a trading system executed through a habit system.

Education will make you a living, self-edification will make you a fortune. And if you think edification is expensive, try ignorance. Everyone’s born incognizant, but one has to strive to remain it.

Hey all - here's a little something I wrote up to practice identifying potentially deceptive/manipulative accounting tactics. Hopefully it helps someone and hopefully you all have some thoughts on this as well since I'm certain there are things I'm not considering when writing this. I definitely don't know everything about Tesla or the subject matter in general, but I thought it was a good example of the practice:

## Identifying Earnings Management by Monitoring Revenue Recognition Policies

In the investing world, there's a concept known as [cookie jar accounting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cookiejaraccounting.asp). This is for all intents and purposes a friendly way of saying legal financial manipulation. Cookie jar accounting is not illegal, but it can be a troubling indicator if it's done chronically, and even in a singular instance it can indicate a potentially significant detriment to future cash flows and earnings. To that end, the intention of this post is not to take a positive or negative position on companies that employ cookie jar accounting or other earnings management tactics, but instead to educate and inform on how the process works and how it can be identified, potentially saving investors from unfavorable earnings surprises and allowing analysts to predict earnings more accurately.

In Q1 of 2018, our friends at Tesla, Inc ([TSLA](https://www.lazyfa.com/TSLA/dashboard/overview/)) updated a key revenue recognition policy:

&gt; We plan to adopt the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018. This will impact the way we account for vehicle sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through our leasing partners, **which now will qualify to be accounted for as sales with a right of return**. In addition, for certain vehicles sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through leasing partners prior to 2018, we will cease recognizing lease revenue starting in 2018 and record the associated cumulative adjustment to equity under the modified retrospective approach. (page 41)

&gt; Vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our near-term cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery. While we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer, **if a customer exercises the option to return the vehicle to us, we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower than our guarantee, or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates or we may be unable to resell the used cars in a timely manner, all of which could adversely impact our cash flows**. (page 41)

&gt; The adoption of the ASUs **will accelerate the revenue recognition of certain vehicle sales** to customers or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee, which will therefore qualify to be accounted for as sales with a right of return as opposed to the current accounting as operating leases or collateralized lease borrowings. (page 80)

Source: [2017 TSLA 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459018002956/tsla-10k_20171231.htm)

This essentially indicated that Tesla planned to begin immediately recognizing revenue which would previously have been recognized over time, and trust that their leasing partners wouldn't exercise their right of return and dump the product back on Tesla, sticking them with a used asset that wasn't worth the revenue they recognized when they sold it and forcing them to adjust their earnings to account for the difference. Of course, because the customers in this case are leasing partners, the policy change was not as blatantly manipulative as something like [channel stuffing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/channelstuffing.asp), but it was certainly a gamble by Tesla management at the very least. Nevertheless, in Q3 2018 Tesla unsurprisingly announced a ""[truly historic quarter](https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/725970e6-eda5-47ab-96e1-422d4045f799)"" with year over year GAAP revenue growth of nearly 130% to $6.82 billion and a ""surprise"" GAAP profit of $1.82/share. This in turn created a buying frenzy sending TSLA stock from just above $250 to nearly $400/share between October and December of 2018. Over the next six months though, Tesla stock bled away these gains in spectacular fashion, hitting lows below $180/share before finally beginning a small recovery. How could investors have seen this coming? How might you have saved yourself from buying Tesla at $375/share only to see it immediately shed more than 50% and decimate your portfolio?

## Enter the [Manipulation Monitor](https://www.lazyfa.com/TSLA/manipulation/overview/):

The first sign that something was amiss actually showed up *before* Tesla's ""historic quarter."" Almost immediately after the 2017 annual report, LazyFA's Manipulation Monitor identified large declines in both [unearned revenue as a percentage of sales](https://lazyfa-lite.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/media/images/tsla_ur_pct_sales_decline.original.png) and [days unearned revenue](https://lazyfa-lite.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/media/images/tsla_dur_halved.original.png). Obviously, this would lead to a decline in the actual [unearned revenue itself](https://lazyfa-lite.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/media/images/tsla_new_revenue_recognition.original.png). This is Tesla with their ""[hands in the cookie jar](https://lazyfa-lite.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/media/images/tsla_unearned_revenue_tapping.original.png)"", accelerating revenue recognition in accordance with the new revenue standard. And of course, depleting that unearned revenue would lead to the simultaneous ""increase"" in recognized revenue. This (partially, in fairness) explains the [huge year over year increase in sales in Q3 and Q4 of 2018](https://lazyfa-lite.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/media/images/tsla_rev_growth.original.png).

As Tesla tapped their unearned revenue over the course of 2018, assets and liabilities related to the adoption of the new revenue standard were shifted around, resulting in a wonderful finish to the year showing operating cash flow of $2.10 billion, a staggering $2.16 billion increase from the previous year's cash outflow of $60 million. This type of [statistical outlier](https://lazyfa-lite.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/media/images/tsla_ocf_outlier.original.png) is a clear red flag, and as such was easily identified by LazyFA's [Red Flag Analysis Engine](https://www.lazyfa.com/TSLA/redflags/overview/). Make no mistake though. Tesla was very clear about the source of these changes. All investors needed to do was read the 10-K:

&gt; This favorable change was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses and gains, of $1.60 billion and the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $554.6 million. The decrease in net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, as a result of increased expenditures to support our ramp of Model 3 deliveries and a net decrease in operating lease vehicles and resale value guarantee liability primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue standard (page 65)

Source: [2018 TSLA 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459019003165/tsla-10k_20181231.htm)

Is it any surprise then, really, that the ""historic"" Q3 2018 and its Q4 successor were not sustainable? While there was certainly some healthy growth in production numbers and legitimate vehicle sales, these increases in revenue, operating cash flow, and earnings per share were largely driven by an accounting change that allowed Tesla to recognize revenue earlier than it normally would have been able to. Subsequently, soon after the announcement of Q3 2018 earnings, Tesla announced that they expected earnings to be much worse in the first half of 2019, which they were. Just look at the [complete 180 from the second half of 2018 to the first half of 2019](https://lazyfa-lite.s3.amazonaws.com/prod/media/images/tsla_gp_ebit_ni_eps.original.png). 

The first half of 2019 was not unexpected for Tesla. It was a reversion to the mean ... a return to normalcy. Management almost certainly knew that this massive positive flip in earnings and cash flow wasn't sustainable, but tapping the cookie jar allowed them to provide the market with a little hope for the future. Being able to identify this type of accounting tactic ahead of time could have saved investors who bought into the hype following Q3 earnings from losing 50% of their investment. Tesla isn't alone in their quest to please Wall Street. Many companies employ these kinds of accounting tricks under pressure to meet analyst expectations and please the market at large. It's up to us as investors to read between the lines.

What do you think? What am I missing that would change my opinion? Obviously not the *entire* flip from negative to positive earnings for a couple quarters was due to accounting tricks. What's your take?

stocks,"I'm curious about how rampant stock manipulation is, specifically on smaller exchanges like the OTC and CSE.

Many people know [r/weedstocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/), but I was hoping to get a more unbiased opinion here. Stock like GTII (GTBIF:OTC) just reported earnings, and they were arguably very strong. They have a \~$1.7 billion US market cap, and just reported $44.7 million US revenue on their latest Q, an increase of 228% YoY and 60% QoQ. Gross margins improved to 52% from 46%, good balance sheet, and there was nothing said on the Conference call that would be interpreted as negative. (Earnings Report [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/08/28/1908014/0/en/Green-Thumb-Industries-GTI-Triples-Revenue-to-44-7-Million-and-Reports-5-0-Million-in-Adjusted-Operating-EBITDA-in-Second-Quarter-2019.html) if you'd like to see the numbers).

Despite the good earnings, and their strong growth potential as more US states open up to Recreational use, the stock went down the day of earnings, and continues to fall today. Down about 65% from their all time high despite consistent QoQ growth and execution from strong management. The US market is expected to be $50+ billion by 2025, so there's definitely growth potential.

On [r/weedstocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/) people say that the stocks are heavily manipulated on these exchanges like the CSE and OTC, and that's why even when they report good earnings, they go down. Now, you could argue they are all massively overvalued, but compared to the Canadian LP's, the US MSO's (Multi State Operators) are much better value, especially if you believe the US will eventually legalize on a federal level.

So my question is, are these stocks actually manipulated by aggressive short selling, or is it truly a question of valuation, and both US/Canadian MJ stocks are over valued?

stocks,"Trying to understand stocks at a fundamental level, wondering if all ""shares"" are worth the same equity percent.  That is to say, if a company has 1000 shares, is each one worth 0.1% of the companies assets in the case of liquidation?  

I understand there are many factors that make the market value of a share different. I am aware of two independent strata shares are classified by:

* Voting rights - variable control of decisions per share
* Preferred vs common- preferred gets priority payout &amp; fixed payouts (all I know right now)

In the case of a distribution, if the fixed payouts exceed the ""percent ownership"" of the preferred stock, they still get their money, common stock gets shafted on their percent ownership.  As far as I know this is the only thing that makes one share worth potentially more ""percent"" in some cases.  Correct me, but it does not seem voting rights have any relation to ""financial entitlement"", unless by choice of the issuer through coinciding higher voting rights on preferred stock

In a Perfect World™ Example:  there are 1000 shares issued.  The company has absolutely no debt to pay.

* Tom has 990 common non-voting shares
* Jerry has 10 ""preferred super voting luxury supreme class AAA"" shares

In the case of liquidation, is Tom entitled to 99% of the liquidated assets value if all fixed payout requirements entitled to Jerry are less than 1% of the total liquidation value?  If so, is this something ""fundamental"", or does it vary country to country, company to company, etc?  Additionally, I assume that in example Jerry had full control of the company while it was running.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

stocks,"One of the trends (I won't call it new), that's influencing stock prices, and also many companie's performance is Ad Tech, i.e. advertising revenue.

Examples : Roku, SnapChat, Zynga, Activision are now deriving a signficant slice of revenue via advertising, just like Facebook, and Google have done for years. Only now its not confined to those 2 giant stocks. Roku is on track to earn about half-a-billion or more via advertising!!  Similar stories for SnapChat, Zynga, other App companies.   Amazon has now entered the field on both ends : technology provider for AdTech / Campaigns (i.e. Amazon's version of Adsense/adwords) and also selling adspace via FireTV.

FB and GOOG had this playground all to themselves, now the field is widened to more entrants. Companies like The Tradedesk I suppose also operate on this space. 

I was lucky enough to invest in Roku without seeing this trend shape the stock, and now this seems to be a huge revenue source for many different companies now.",The AdTech trend
stocks,"Not willing to start a conspiracy theory but I noticed how Trump remarks on China tariff create such high volatility that a well informed investor could easily make a lot of money out of that. Lately, I've been buying on the well-off that are nearly weekly and selling after a nice and easy 3-5% bump. So far I did ~50%. Eventually I know this cannot be sustained. People are still risk friendly right now so we see these big movements. 

Anyway, knowing that Trump has done sketchy stuff with stock. I remember reading at one point he was saying he'd take over a company and on the side he was selling his shares that got a nice bump after his false intentions of taking over the company. 

To me, it smells like it right now. How likely is it do you think? Have you noticed this as well? It's like they want it on purpose to play with people's sentiments and just play the market.",Trump and stock market

stocks,"I want to know if I'm thinking about capitol gain tax correctly. Tell me if I am right or wrong please. Let's say you have $10,000 you invest. You invest $6000 in stock A and $4000 in stock B. 

Throughout the year:

Stock A rises 20% making its total worth $7200. Gain of $1200.

Stock B falls 20% making it worth $3200. Loss of $800.

Within the same year you sell both stocks within days of each other. My question now is what would you have to pay taxes on. It would make sense that you would only have to pay taxes on $1200-$800= $400 because this is what you actually profited, but is this actually how it is, or do you have to pay tax on each realized gain and count each realized loss against your total income that you pay taxes on? Basically would you have to pay taxes on the $1200 that you gained and then get to deduct the loss of $800 from your taxable income? These aren't the same things if I'm thinking about this correctly?",Question Regarding Taxes on Stocks

stocks,[removed],Where should I buy into the stock market as a beginner who’s very interested in investing.
stocks,"I know people say disregard recession, invest now and always. 

But looking at the 5 year track for many stocks it seems difficult for me to get into it now.  For example Nvidia was $20 per share 5 years ago. And its $170 now.  Amazon was a $300/ share and now its $1700/ share.  It's obvious the market has grown exponentially well in the last 5 to 10 years.  Even though I only gave 2 examples a lot of the market seems to be at a premium right now.  

So should I buy into stocks like apple, google, amazon, microsoft, now while they are at an all time high and expect them to continue growing. Or should I look for stocks that are coming up now and will be higher in the next 5 years.  A lot of people made wealth by buying into these companies but 5 years ago I could have purchased almost 6 shares of amazon for the price of one today.

stocks,"US-headquartered Mylan and Pfizer have announced a definitive agreement to combine Mylan with Upjohn, Pfizer’s off-patent branded and generic established medicines business. The merge will create a new global pharmaceutical company.

The new company will be domiciled in the US, and incorporated in Delaware and will operate Global Centers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Shanghai, China, and Hyderabad, India. The new business is expected to have pro forma 2020 revenues ranging US$19 to $20 billion.

Mylan brings a diverse portfolio across many geographies and key therapeutic areas, such as central nervous system and anaesthesia, infectious disease and cardiovascular, as well as a robust pipeline, high-quality manufacturing and supply chain excellence.

Upjohn brings trusted, iconic brands, such as Lipitor (atorvastatin calcium), Celebrex (celecoxib) and Viagra (sildenafil), and proven commercialisation capabilities, including leadership positions in China and other emerging markets.

Robert J. Coury, Mylan Chairman, commented: ""The new company, which combines the unique assets of Mylan with the iconic brands of Pfizer’s Upjohn business, will not only accelerate our mission to serve the world’s changing health needs, but also further unlock the true value of our platform while delivering attractive returns to shareholders for many years to come.""

Coury said the combined organisation will have a presence across nearly every continent and major market, establishing a new leadership position in Asia, and offering products capable of treating all major therapeutic areas. ""This combination also further accelerates Mylan’s longstanding strategy to create the operational scale and commercial capabilities necessary to provide the world’s more than seven billion people with access to medicine.""

We are creating a new champion for global health—one poised to bring world-class medicines to patients across a wide range of therapeutic areas

The transaction will allow the new company to meaningfully expand the geographic reach of Mylan’s existing broad product portfolio and future pipeline—including significant investments that have been made across complex generics and biosimilars—into new growth markets where Upjohn has existing sales infrastructure and local market expertise.

Dr Albert Bourla, Pfizer CEO, commented: “We are creating a new champion for global health—one poised to bring world-class medicines to patients across a wide range of therapeutic areas.""

For Bourla, by bringing Mylan’s growth assets to Upjohn’s growth markets, the companies will create a financially strong business with true global reach.

""I’m also excited about the management team, which combines strong executive talent from both companies, whose commitment to improving global health for patients and to delivering returns to shareholders are great assets for the new company,"" Bourla said.

Under the terms of the agreement, which is structured as an all-stock Reverse Morris Trust transaction, each Mylan share would be converted into one share of the new company

The total amount we all paid in taxes last year — federal, state and local — was $5.51 trillion. This tax increase that has everyone’s panties in a twist is a rounding error. Meanwhile, the total value wiped off U.S. stocks during Monday’s panic was about $700 billion. More than 20 years’ worth of the new tariffs.”

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.
