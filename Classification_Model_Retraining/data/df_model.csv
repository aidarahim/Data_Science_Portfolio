1,"*I wrote this as a reply to a LPT post about using your floor mats to get yourself unstuck.  I've never tried that, maybe it'll get you free, but why get out oi you don't need to?*

##Use your brakes.

Seriously.  If you're on a slippery surface most of your power is going to the wheel with the least traction.  If you could get out and watch yourself in this situation you would see that only one wheel is spinning.  This is because of a part of your drivetrain called a differential.  In most cars there is nothing that prevents any one wheel from spinning much faster than the others because that's more expensive.

If you're stuck, try lightly pressing on the brake peddle while you give the car a little gas.  This keeps that one wheel from breaking loose and spinning uncontrollably.  You'll prolly have to experiment a little with pressure on each of the peddles - this is true for people with lots or little experience in this situation because cars, tires, weather, and road conditions vary so much.

TO: Dumbfuck Mc Poopypants

   
 

RE: 2008 Scion tC VIN# G0F15TY0UR531F455H0L3 Title Lien

   
 

Mr. Mc Poopypants,

   
 

I have made every attempt to resolve this matter in a civilized manner. You interrupted me and wouldn’t let me finish when I tried to explain this to you over the phone so I have no choice but to make this a formal legal matter. Let’s not mince words. I used to sell cars and I know how you people operate. I’ve seen underhanded deals with resulting lawsuits before. I’m not the average ignorant consumer you can just roll over. You had the opportunity to get out of this situation quickly and quietly. You no longer have that opportunity. The civil attorney with 25 years of experience in title law with whom I consulted informed me that I would not need him because I have an airtight case against you. He said, and I quote,

   
 

“Take that lien and shove it up their ass. It’s their fault. They missed it. They own it now.”

   
 

If you do not comply with this demand letter, I will have no choice but to take legal action, which I am entirely prepared to do. You will lose. Pursuant to Statute 12.341 A.R.S., you will also be held responsible for my legal fees of $450 per hour plus expenses, plus penalties, plus compensation for the backlog of hours I have wasted doing your job for you and investigating your mistakes. 

   
 

Be advised that this letter will be tendered in court as evidence of your failure to comply with the law and your attempt to defraud me. This has the potential to cost Incompetent Dumbfucks, Inc significantly more than the $1,050 that you’ll be paying off for me immediately whether you force me to take you to court or not. This is entirely your decision.

   
 

Pursuant to the law regarding automotive title liens in Goat Rodeo County, your dealership missed a First In Time, First In Right occurrence that you should have caught three separate times. This requires a Release of Wrongful Lien for which Incompetent Dumbfucks, Inc. is 100% responsible.

   
 

On 30 December 2020, I purchased my 2008 Scion tC VIN# G0F15TY0UR531F455H0L3 which will remain in my possession. Unbeknownst to me, I had outstanding fines in two areas totaling $3850, which in turn caused the lien on the title, which should have been found through your due diligence and prevented the sale from ever going through in the first place. Upon consulting the Goat Rodeo County Collector, I was informed that processes and procedures had been provided by the county specifically to make it easier for auto dealers to find such discrepancies and prevent this exact situation from occurring because it had been such a frequent problem for so many people. 

   
 

Apparently, your third-party title company was able to make the $2800 from my unrelated case disappear. Based on your suggestion, I spoke to someone who worked at the MVD and they informed me that that happens not infrequently because they make so many mistakes. They informed me that third part title company employees have 10% of the training that MVD employees do but that managers are typically former MVD employees with connections who can clear fines with a mouse click if they get the right person to do them a favor. The fact that they did so sets a legal precedent of responsibility on your part. Guilt has already been established. If they were not liable, they would not have done that. Since they are liable, you are liable as well. What remains is two abandoned vehicle fines for $500 each and a $50 fine for driving uninsured totaling $1,050. Due to the fact that you missed this in your due diligence three times, you have inherited 100% financial responsibility for these fines.

   
 

Due to the aforementioned provisions, this deal never should have happened three times over. You missed it three times. You failed to do your due diligence three times. This is an impressive level of incompetence. I will not be held accountable for your ineptitude. Directly after the deal was finished and the 2008 Scion was officially in my possession, I went to the Motor Vehicle Division to register for handicapped license plates, to which I am entitled due to my various disabilities. Upon discovering the lien, I attempted to return the car in good faith. You told me that everything was fine, that the lien would transfer and that the only issue would be that I would not be able to sell or trade in the Scion until the fines were paid off. Whether it was incompetence, negligence, fraud, or some combination of the three, I received wrong information and made a major financial decision based on that wrong information. If I had been given the correct information, I absolutely would have backed out of the deal.

   
 

This is Fraud. 

   
 

I’m willing to give you the benefit of the doubt under Hanlon’s Razor and assume this was not intentional fraud, but simply gross incompetence, which is the only thing you and your employees have displayed consistently. The fact remains that it is fraud, whether intentional or not, and it falls upon your dealership to resolve it to avoid further legal action, which I will absolutely take if you force my hand.

   
 

The fact that I informed your dealership of the lien when I attempted to return the Scion in good faith should have alerted you that there was a problem but you missed it again and went ahead and sold my 2007 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor VIN# Y0UL053N33DL3D1CKD1P5H1TF4C3 at auction. This was the 2nd time that you failed to do your due diligence. Upon finding out that the new owner of my trade-in had spent $1200 on new parts in good faith, you asked me to pay for your mistake. This was completely unethical but in no way out of character for a car dealership. Without my help, you corrected the error on your end. I’m sure a massive corporation like Incompetent Dumbfucks, Inc. won’t have a problem coming up with the rest. That is what will happen with the remaining $1,050 due to the fact that every last one of the plethora of failings in this situation is 100% your fault. 

   
 

Furthermore, you threatened to repossess my car, which you do not have the legal right to do, in an attempt to intimidate me into paying for your egregious error yet again. This was even more unethical but certainly no less within your purview. At the bottom line, you’re trying to get me to pay for your mistakes. I will not be intimidated. You will not get dime one out of me. This is 100% your problem. You’re taking a bath on this deal and there’s nothing you can do about it.

   
 

Upon receiving my Interceptor back, since I still had the chance of backing out of the deal, I asked Blumpkin Stankyballs again to make sure I would not be immediately liable for those fines. He reaffirmed what I had been told previously, that my car was already registered through the dealership and I would be receiving my license plates in the mail. I also spoke with Douchebag van Assbreath during the transaction and he yet again affirmed what I had been told. I did my due diligence by confirming this with both of them. I took them at their word based on the fact that they do this for a living. This was the 3rd time you failed to do your due diligence. The attorney I consulted said he had never seen a case this badly bungled. The extreme carelessness and aggressive incompetence displayed by you and your employees time and time again indicates that you people simply do not know how to do your jobs. 

   
 

I will not be a victim of your negligence.

   
 

As I mentioned, the official legal way for you to resolve this matter is through a Release of Wrongful Lien action. I suggest you consult your legal department and get that process started. 

   
 

Alternately, you might want to take up a collection among the employees involved so no one loses his job. If I were your general manager, I’d be handing out pink slips like they were parking tickets. If you would prefer to send me a cashier’s check or money order for $1,050 made out to the Goat Rodeo County Collector, I would be more than happy to pay off the fines through the standard means to make this easier for everyone. 

   
 

It is in both of our best interests not to take this to court, but I need to make sure this is abundantly clear; based on the rock-solid case I have against you, you need to understand in no uncertain terms that I absolutely will take this to court without hesitation and pursue it to the fullest extent of the law for as long as it takes to protect my rights. You have been warned.

   
 

Please inform me of how this matter has been resolved no later than 26 February 2021 and approximately when I should expect to receive my license plate and registration. I will need to know by which method you have chosen to rectify the outstanding $1,050 so I can take the appropriate steps.

   
 

   
 

**Do Not** force me to take you to court. You don’t know who you’re fucking with and you don’t want to find out.

   
 

Sincerely,

1,"Venture capitalists in theory are private equity investors who invest in companies and make them more profitable. In reality, they are vultures who do all they can to wring companies dry in order to make themselves a profit. 

Venture capitalists do not care about company history, culture, or mission. They do not care about the people working there. The only thing they are concerned about is making themselves as much profit as possible as quickly as possible. Most venture capitalists don’t even keep the companies they purchase that long. They gut them, pocket the money, resell the company, and move on.

When a venture capitalist comes in, they are looking to trim expenses at the company in order to maximize their own profits. The largest expense at almost any company is payroll. Therefore the venture capitalists begin firing the majority of the people working there. Institutional knowledge and leadership do not matter, the only employees they will retain are the fewest number of cheapest workers they think can still run the business. Even if you are not one of the people fired, the quality of life at the job - not to mention the work the company is doing - will drastically go downhill.

I have been at three companies that have been purchased by venture capitalists. Every single time the individual stood up at a meeting, addressed the assembled employees, gave some bull about how happy they were to be there, how they looked to make the company better than ever, how no one would be let go, and how we were all going to work together to make sure the company’s best days were ahead. Every single time the layoffs started shortly thereafter. At the first company I was at, 65% of the workforce was laid off. The second company was 80% laid off and the third was 75%.

BUT: It takes venture capitalists a little while to assess the company they’ve bought and to go through records to decide who they want to fire. USE THAT TIME TO YOUR ADVANTAGE! Don’t wait around to be fired. Instead be proactive. Get out there and start looking for a new job immediately! In my experience, it usually takes a month between the sale of the company and when the layoffs start, which is a great chunk of time to find a new job.

A friend of mine did this at my first job and left for a new career just before the layoffs happened. I learned from her and did it the next time. One of the best decisions I’ve ever made!","LPT: If your company is purchased by a venture capitalist, immediately begin looking for a new job.",99,17

If your house has limited power, make one room the warm one. Sheets, blankets or newspaper over the windows and doors. Create blanket doors if need be. Insulate as small of an area as is comfortable and keep it your main hang out spot. Cuddle.

Candles can create some heat but you can optimize them by utilizing clay pots or cast iron pans. Place candle in safe area and cover flame something like this . The idea is to heat something with the flame that is non-flammable, dense and relatively close to the ground. Safety is paramount.

If you can have a bbq or open fire in a safe place, keep a hot pot of water going, ya never know.

If you have to go out in the snow, keep dry...especially your feet. Throw plastic bags over your socks before putting shoes on if your footwear is inadequate. If there is snow everywhere and the sun does not seem to be shining, wear sunglasses anyway. Snow blind is a thing that can sneak up on you.

If you are worried about your water lines freezing, you can either shut off the main and open all the taps in your house or keep a slow dribble going from your taps at all times...watch those drains, they can freeze too.

Since 2005 we've had 8 hurricanes and as many tropical storms; my parents have never lost power for more than a day. 

I lived with my parents in 2005 and stayed behind throughout mandatory evac during hurricane rita. The day after I talked to a cop at a gas station.  We discussed the carnage and he said the energy company was predicting it may take months (with an ""s"") to restore power. Then tells me not to worry bc my parents neighborhood would be back up ASAP.  When power goes out the disaster headquarters' node in our town is priority number one. I'm not sure if it's like this everywhere, but it would make sense. You'd have to check your area, but in many counties FEMA likes to commandeer super walmarts when ""smash glass"" time arrives. They're likely designed and built on a beefed up or at least priority repair grid. 

Through all the storms my parents have never lost power for more than a day; the rest of the town has been down for up to a month.

-Open up your faucet about a half a turn. Just enough to get a pencil size stream. Yes it will raise your bill a bit but it will be nothing compared to a 3/4"" line freezing or bursting. 

-Invest in foam insulators, think ones that look like pool noodles. Even they will work. 

-If you have a line freeze try pouring hot water on it to get it thawed. You can get snow and if you have power or if power is out and you still have gas heat it til it's hot, not boiling. Boiling will cause pipes to stretch and that won't be good.

1,"Hey all,

I'm sure most of you know this, but in case you didn't;

Most people these days book hotels online. Mostly via Booking.com, Agoda, Expedia, so on.. Airbnb even make hotel booking now.

Now, let's say you come upon a deal whilst searching. One company is offering a mobile only deal, or is far cheaper than the others. Don't book it just yet.

The way these companies make money is by charging the hotel anywhere between 10-30% commission. Hotels hate this. So if you call them and explain the price, they will match it. Some will say, 'you have to show this on arrival'. 

This is because the hotels can adjust the rate themselves and will change the price online. It does take a few minutes though. Say don't worry and you'll book it via the third party website then, reminding them about the commission. They will jump at the chance to take your money directly.

Now, if your calling in the middle of the day, ask to speak to the Front Office Manager. They have more authority when adjusting rates. Insist that since you are saving the hotel money, you'd like a discount on or an included breakfast in the rate, free airport transfers, 5% off the website price. 

How much more you can bargain for is completely up to your negotiating skills. Look at what is offered in the package. No point in asking for breakfast if it's included already.

Hope this helps 😊",LPT: How to get a hotel room cheaper,36,8

1,"Trigger warning: Mentioning of bodily fluids and incisions.


I have always bit my nails since I was young. not really out of a habit but more I'm just too lazy to go find my nail cutters and I can do it while I drive. Occasionally because of the way I bite it a little piece might stick out into my skin and make it swell. Typically this goes away in a day or so. Not this time.

Monday night I noticed my finger was swelling up on one side. I didn't think much until I got out of work on Tuesday and realized it was very tender and swollen. I reached out to a friend who is a nurse to ask his opinion and he recommended a couple things to try and if it didn't get better to go to the urgent Care. 

A few hours later nothing had helped and it seemed just as bad if not worse. I went in and found out I had a Paronychia. They had to numb my finger by doing injection at the base of my middle finger. They then had to cut into the section to the right of the nail bed, which if any of you, like me, has never had to do anything like this, there are a ton of nerve endings and it is incredibly painful even after the numbing.

So long story short if I wasn't lazy and just cut my nails like a normal human being I wouldn't have had to deal with some of the worst pain in my life.",LPT: If you bite your fingernails stop now and use a nail cutter.

James Clear says a mental model is an explanation of how something works. A worldview you carry in your mind to interpret the world and understand the relationship between things. Mental Models are deeply held beliefs about how the world works.

Charlie Munger, Buffett's business partner and the Godfather of mental models, says you don’t need to know more, you need to think better. The more tools you have, the more well-rounded thinker you’ll become.

One of the most powerful mental models is called inversion, inspired by 19th-century mathematician Carl Jacobi. “Invert, always invert.” Look at a situation upside down, what happens if plans go bad?

“Tell me where I’m going to die so I don’t go there.” -Charlie Munger. That about sums it up! Inversion is a model that requires us to think about problems nonlinearly, starting at the end and working backward to avoid any pitfalls.

Inversion is about risk aversion. Let’s think about how to practice this. Instead of asking ourselves, “what do I need to make this thing go right,” let’s ask, “what could make this go terribly wrong.”

Ever wanted to upgrade your own efficiency at work? Instead of asking yourself how to accomplish those goals in the affirmative, ask yourself why you might not accomplish them.

Here are a few: you don’t take time to reset your mind mid-day, you go to bed too late and wake up groggy, etc… What can you do? Deliberately time-block your days for more structure, give yourself breaks at regular intervals to help you focus, discipline yourself to go to bed at a specific time each night.

Ok, a non-biz example: let’s say you want to run a marathon. What are some reasons you might not achieve that goal? You have a lack of accountability, you don’t consider physical effects on your body, etc… Let’s back into some forward-looking solutions. Train with others to keep yourself accountable, think from the outset about how running can impact your body to avoid injury, etc…

Now it’s your turn! Take a goal or item on your to-do-list and invert it. Think backward — what reasons won’t you accomplish those? Write those reasons down and solutions to each of those reasons, and finally put it into action. Go do it!

Hope this helped you as much as it helped me!

Here is the text from [a deleted post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/43iyip/our_family_of_5_lost_everything_in_a_fire/) of former Insurance Company worker that will help you get the amount of money that you are entitled to:
  
Hey OP... I used to be the guy who worked for insurance companies, and determined the value of every little thing in your house. The guy who would go head-to-head with those fire-truck-chasing professional loss adjusters. I may be able to help you not get screwed when filing your claim.

Our goal was to use the information you provided, and give the lowest damn value we can possibly justify for your item.

For instance, if all you say was ""toaster"" -- we would come up with a cheap-as-fuck $4.88 toaster from Walmart, meant to toast one side of one piece of bread at a time. And we would do that for every thing you have ever owned. We had private master lists of the most commonly used descriptions, and what the cheapest viable replacements were. We also had wholesale pricing on almost everything out there, so really scored cheap prices to quote. To further that example:

    If you said ""toaster - $25"" , we would have to be within -20% of that... so, we would find something that's pretty much dead-on $20.01.
    If you said ""toaster- $200"" , we'd kick it back and say NEED MORE INFO, because that's a ridiculous price for a toaster (with no other information given.)
    If you said ""toaster, from Walmart"" , you're getting that $4.88 one.
    If you said ""toaster, from Macys"" , you'd be more likely to get a $25-35 one.
    If you said ""toaster"", and all your other kitchen appliances were Jenn Air / Kitchenaid / etc., you would probably get a matching one.
    If you said ""Proctor Silex 42888 2-Slice Toaster from Wamart, $9"", you just got yourself $9.
    If you said ""High-end Toaster, Stainless Steel, Blue glowing power button"" ... you might get $35-50 instead. We had to match all features that were listed.

I'm not telling you to lie on your claim. Not at all. That would be illegal, and could cause much bigger issues (i.e., invalidating the entire claim). But on the flip side, it's not always advantageous to tell the whole truth every time. Pay attention to those last two examples.

I remember one specific customer... he had some old, piece of shit projector (from mid-late 90s) that could stream a equally piece of shit consumer camcorder. Worth like $5 at a scrap yard. It had some oddball fucking resolution it could record at, though -- and the guy strongly insisted that we replace with ""Like Kind And Quality"" (trigger words). Ended up being a $65k replacement, because the only camera on the market happened to be a high-end professional video camera (as in, for shooting actual movies). $65-goddam-thousand-dollars because he knew that loophole, and researched his shit.

Remember to list fucking every -- even the most mundane fucking bullshit you can think of. For example, if I was writing up the shower in my bathroom:

    Designer Shower Curtain - $35
    Matching Shower Curtain Liner for Designer Shower Curtain - $15
    Shower Curtain Rings x20 - $15
    Stainless Steel Soap Dispenser for Shower - $35
    Natural Sponge Loofah - from Whole Foods - $15
    Natural Sponge Loofah for Back - from Whole Foods - $19
    Holder for Loofahs - $20
    Bars of soap - from Lush - $12 each (qty: 4)
    Bath bomb - from Lush - $12
    High end shampoo - from salon - $40
    High end conditioner - from salon - $40
    Refining pore mask - from salon - $55

I could probably keep thinking, and bring it up to about $400 for the contents of my shower. Nothing there is ""unreasonable"" , nothing there is clearly out of place, nothing seems obviously fake. The prices are a little on the high-end, but the reality is, some people have expensive shit -- it won't actually get questioned. No claims adjuster is going to bother nitpicking over the cost of fucking Lush bath bombs, when there is a 20,000 item file to go through. The adjuster has other shit to do, too.

Most people writing claims for a total loss wouldn't even bother with the shower (it's just some used soap and sponges..) -- and those people would be losing out on $400.

Some things require documentation &amp; ages. If you say ""tv - $2,000"" -- you're getting a 32"" LCD, unless you can provide it was from the last year or two w/ receipts. Hopefully you have a good paper trail from credit/debit card expenditure / product registrations / etc.

If you're missing paper trails for things that were legitimately expensive -- go through every photo you can find that was taken in your house. Any parties you may have thrown, and guests put pics up on Facebook. Maybe an Imgur photo of your cat, hiding under a coffee table you think you purchased from Restoration Hardware. Like... seriously... come up with any evidence you possibly can, for anything that could possibly be deemed expensive.

The fire-truck chasing loss adjusters are evil sons of bitches, but, they actually do provide some value. You will definitely get more money, even if they take a cut. But all they're really doing, is just nitpicking the ever-living-shit out of everything you possibly owned, and writing them all up ""creatively"" for the insurance company to process.

Sometimes people would come back to us with ""updated* claims. They tried it on their own, and listed stuff like ""toaster"", ""microwave"", ""tv"" .. and weren't happy with what they got back. So they hired a fire-truck chaser, and re-submitted with ""more information."" I have absolutely seen claims go from under $7k calculated, to over $100k calculated.

Bonus tip (s): slaming on the brakes of your car doesn't work in snow and ice. It just makes you slide. If you lose control of your car just stop fighting it: literally let go of the steering wheel and take your foot of the brake. The car will usually just roll to a stop, which is a lot safer than skidding to a stop. 


If you end up in a ditch and think you'll be stuck there for a while, make sure to get out of the car every few minutes to clear snow out of your exhaust pipe.

1,"This is specific to people for whom COVID relief phase-outs come into play.

If your 2018/2019 income put you in or above the phase-out for previous rounds but your 2020 income was low enough that you would've qualified (or you had a baby and qualify as a result!), it's to your advantage to file your taxes sooner rather than later. Not only will you get a credit worth the difference between what you should've gotten and what you did get, but you will also likely get a higher amount from the relief currently under consideration. Particularly if your 2020 income drop was unique to 2020 and your income will be back up in 2021, filing before the payments are issued could be to your benefit.

Conversely, if your 2020 income rose relative to 2018/2019, you might be best-off if you wait to file your taxes. You could get a bigger direct payment and likely will not need to repay anything, even if your income winds up higher for 2021.

Take a look at the phase-outs (for the previous two direct payments, multiply the amount you exceeded the threshold by 5% to get the reduction amount) compared to your 2019 income, 2020 income, and 2021 expected income, to figure out what is the best for you. If it's confusing (it is!), a tax professional may be worth the expense.

For reference, my wife and I had a baby in 2020; our income dropped by $20k relative to 2019 due to lost wages, and the added dependent made us eligible for even more. In 2021, our income will wind up higher than in 2019, so we're likely to be *much* better off by filing as soon as possible, assuming a third direct payments package is passed.","LPT: If your financial situation changed substantially in 2020 relative to 2019, you may want to file your taxes either sooner or later, considering the expected COVID relief package",182,29

1,"Many people view college as an “experience” and not a pathway to increasing their earning potential. Sure, everybody would love to move to a deferent state, and spend four years studying cool stuff and partying with their friend, but everybody cannot afford to have this experience. On the flip side, if you view college as an investment in your future earning potential, and make several fiscally responsible decisions, college is actually affordable. 

1. Match the earning potential of the degree to the cost of the institution. Don’t move from Ohio to attend NYU for an education degree. It’s fiscally irresponsible. Unless you have money to burn, or a scholarship, this is a no-no. 

2. Get you first 60 credits at a community college (cc), then transfer to a university. CC credits are a fraction of the cost, and many CCs have direct transfer programs to major universities in the area. In the end, your diploma will look just like everybody else’s. 

3. Don’t fall into the mind trap that you have to finish in 4 years. Almost no undergrad program makes this stipulation. I took 7 years and worked full time all the way through. 

4. If possible, live at home, or at worst, rent a room in a house. You may have less space, but you will also have less bills. 

5. Apply for grants. If you are broke, you will get grant money. 

To prove my point, I looked up current costs of going to the same schools I did. The CC college is $150/credit hour, and the University is $350/credit hour.

60 x $150 = $9000

60 x $350 = $21000

$200/class for books and supplies x 40 classes = $8000

Total = $38k. If you spread this out to 6 years (72 months, that $520/month. Assuming you are not eligible for any grants, that’s still affordable if you choose a degree path that has jobs readily available upon graduation. In addition, this path allowed me to focus on my studies, and I earned a 3.7 GPA, which is significantly higher than many of my peers. It had really helped several times, including my recent application to grad school. 

Stop letting people tell you college isn’t affordable. Reframe the problem, avoid mind traps, and work within your budget, and you will be fine. Best of luck improving your earning potential!","LPT: Reframe the way you look at getting a college education, and suddenly it becomes affordable!",97,16

1,"Hi all.

I have spent a lot of time getting jobs, doing well at them and fighting for higher compensation. I have worked for both startups and corporate companies, as well as spending plenty of time as an independent contractor. So I've been around the block with negotiation of compensation. I've found that the sky really is the limit for success, provided you have the right mindset. Our world is so full of opportunities.

Essentially, when you’re working for someone, you need to do two things:

1. Do exactly what they ask.
2. Ask for exactly what you want.

You need to be a kick-ass employee. What does this mean? It is the same as being a straight A student. You leave your ego at the door and become a reliable team member. You don't focus on doing things *perfectly* or *your way*, you focus on doing things the way your boss or senior team members want them done.

You can still be creative and weigh in on things, but this is how you become respected. You be willing to do things the way someone asks.

Once you become known as a core contributor on a team, a team player and a reliable person, the key is to shoot far beyond your own limiting expectations.

*No boss will ever want to give you a raise out of nowhere.*

You *have* to ask.

The truth is, an amazing employee is worth their weight in gold.

So make the expectations clear. Look at the average salary for your job role, then look at the top 10% percentile of salaries. Notice how they're so much higher? Those aren't the geniuses, those are the people who *ask for what they want*.

So if you're a software developer and the average salary for your position is $100k, shoot for $150k. If the boss shoots you down, you either aren't a good enough employee or the company literally can't make it happen.

If the company can't make it happen, ask them how they can help you reach your goal. Do you need to get a promotion? How can you make that happen? Do you need to crush it for another year? Ask exactly what metrics you need to hit. Then *follow up* with your boss an annoying amount to make sure you're on track.

*This is how you get fast tracked for success*.

If the company is not willing to play ball, to reward you for going above and beyond, find a new company. There are plenty.

I understand mental health has become a largely talked about issue these days as it always should have been, and I hope this post helps you implement a new tool you can use to improve your mental well-being. Here it is!

LIFE HACK on regret or mistakes: Unfortunately most of us dwell on negative things that have happened to us or ruminate on a mistake we once made. Usually these thoughts are most difficult right after the incident and these thoughts torture us numerous times throughout the day making us feel helpless towards the mental chatter in our brain.

Here is where we implement our life hack; we are going to make this recurring mental worry turn from a negative to a positive. 

Once you catch yourself criticizing your past actions, or feeling anxious about what has happened to you, you are going to do something that you would consider a positive action. This could be many things both internally or externally. Perhaps you will try to be just a bit kinder to the next person you interact with, or you could think of one thing you are grateful for in the present moment.

You shall continue to take these positive actions every time you start thinking or feeling poorly about your past. Try to keep track of the new positive things you are adding into your life. As your positive actions build up, you may start to view your initial mistake as a blessing, as it has become a trigger for you to implement positivity instead of negativity into your life. Perhaps your initial worries will even fade away.

Once sort of variation might be adding the first letter of the site that you are registering with. So for reddit it might be: **rPassword1234**

That's not the best change but its still an improvement since your passwords are rarely going to be the exact same between sites so if one gets leaked, no automated system will find your other accounts. For more security you can take the same principle and make it more complex.

For example, using the second and the second-to-last characters to sandwich the password. For reddit it would be: **ePassword1234i**

Examples: 

My '95 ranger. Idled very poorly, and would stall out often and unpredictably. Scared the shit out of my fiance when it stalled out at a red light. Checked when we got home, the bracket for the throttle cable in the engine was bent, causing it to slip off the idle set screw from time to time. Took 5 min to diag and fox with my leatherman. 

Fiance's 2015 crosstrek. Couldn't turn the key all the way off sometimes, and was hard to turn. They got scared and panicked about how much it was going to cost before even looking up what it might be. Turned out the key was damaged by the previous owner and we just hadn't noticed it. Swapped to the other key, and no issues. 

On the other end, tho not to scare you, my parents 2012 impreza. Brand new, just a few months old, just some lights on the dash. No driveability issues, no noises, no nothing. Turned out the engineering disaster of a cvt subaru uses (personal opinion, not a fan of cvts) was bad, $6000 bill.

1,"As a hobby buyer and reseller, I've been scammed four times in a couple weeks. If you see a wildly discounted deal on something you love it's probably not a real deal, specifically if it's a high ticket item. Here are some ways to avoid getting scammed straight from my bad luck/lack of experience. Dont be like me! Lol  


1. If you're buying something over ebay or fb marketplace ask for a receipt from where they bought it, especially if you're buying sneakers or something else high value with lots of reproductions. If they don't have the receipt that doesn't always mean anything, but if they're not willing to show you, or are argumentative about it, that's a red flag.
2. Ask to see more photos of things that are specific on the item to make sure it's legit. If someone is serious about wanting to sell you something, especially if it's a high ticket item, they'll be happy to take you the photos you ask for. If they're not willing to that's another red flag.
3. ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS and I do mean ALWAYS use paypal goods and services or paypal invoices to pay for items from marketplace or craigslist. A notable exception is paying cash in person after looking at the item. This protects both of you from fraud and I highly recommend it if you're asking for something to be shipped. There's no recourse to get your money back if you pay a different way (venmo, cashapp, zelle, etc) and they don't ship you the item.
4. If you're going to meet up in person but you have to keep hounding them about the location or the time, and they're generally not responsive or don't want to meet in a public place it's most likely a scam. True sellers will be willing to meet in a safe neutral public location and will be responsive and generally pretty willing to accomodate your requests.
5. NEVER and I do mean NEVER send the money up front to ""hold"" the item for you over other buyers. Now if you're using paypal goods and services to have someone ship you something that's a different story, if they scam you, you can get your money back. What I'm referencing here is craigslist/fb marketplace scams that show something really high value for an almost impossible deal. Often these scams will show pictures and have some kind of story attached like they're a widow who's selling their husband's things, and say don't ask too many questions becuase I'm too overwhelmed by everything, I just need the money, etc. When you reach out you'll get a person to talk to, however they don't have paypal or won't use it etc. You'll ask about the high value item and they'll say there's already a few people interested and sending them money to hold it for them unless you can send half sooner etc. DON'T FALL FOR IT NO MATTER HOW REAL THEY SEEM.
6. Trust your gut! If something seems off or too good to be true it likely is. There's rarely people who won't google what they have these days to get an average ball park of what it's worth. You're much more likely to get a deal by offering to negotiate than by finding a diamond being sold by someone who doesn't know what they have.
7. Don't be afraid to disappoint someone by backing out of the deal. If it feels off in any way or your gut is telling you not to do it, it is okay to say you changed your mind. As a people pleaser and an overly polite person myself I often feel bad saying no or worrying about disappointing someone. This has lead to some bad decisions on my part. You are more than allowed to change your mind or back out at any time. Even if it's in person and you're looking at something and it doesn't look right.

1,"So I’ve not posted to this sub before, but a friend told me I should, because hey, it might help some people! :)

Basically I know everyone lives with a calculator in their pocket today via their smart phones. But this one is for the people who work on cash registers or have to take payments over the phone, basically those that have to do a quick bit of maths/math when dealing with a client.

(and I know to some people it’ll seem fairly obvious, and if it is to you, hey, you’re smart :) )

But basically, if you have to multiply two numbers together, you can cut one of the numbers in half, and double the other number, and you still get the same answer to your original question.

So if I asked you “what is 32 multiplied by 64?”  unless you’re pretty skilled at maths in general, you wouldn’t be able to whip up the answer without really having to think about it or writing it down. But if we use this technique, we’ll be just fine :)

So if we cut 32 in half, to make it 16, we’d have to double 64, to become 128.

32 x 64 becomes:
16 x 128

And just keep going like that.

16 cut in half, becomes 8
128 doubled, becomes 256
Giving us  8 x 256

And we do it again.
8 becomes 4
256 becomes 512
Giving us 4 x 512
And again.

4 becomes 2
512 becomes 1024
Giving us 2 x 1024

2 finally becomes 1
And 1024 finally becomes 2048.

And boom, there’s your answer. 32 multiplied by 64 is 2048.


As long as one of the numbers in your original question is divisible by 2 or 3, you can do this all the time.


TL;DR if you have to multiply two numbers together, and one of them is divisible by 2 or 3, you can half one of the numbers in the equation, whilst doubling the other number, to give you the same answer. 32x64 is 2048.",LPT Quick Maths,15,3

1," Each work has pressure, yet the work environment climate can appear to be practically horrendous when working for an over-requesting or unreasonable boss. This guide contains stress management tips that shows you how to manage stress at work and deal with a difficult boss.

To be honest, you don't need to like your line manager, yet you do should have the option to coincide and co-work with him for you to be gainful and fruitful at your particular employment. There is no ideal answer on how to manage a troublesome boss. However, there are a few recommendations that may make your circumstance somewhat less agonizing.

**#1) Think of your manager as a parent and you as his adolescent kid.**

This sounds senseless from the outset, yet the connection between you and your manager is fundamentally the same as that between a parent and youngster. Young people regularly have issues with power and experience conflicts with their folks. Then, often the guardians have to make decisions that the youngster believes to be unacceptable. The circumstances can get adequately awful before the kid matures enough to figure out that he needs to move out and live alone. Parents or guardians are not always lovable nor are supervisors - both can make poor judgement calls. This is something that is worth remembering always.

**#2) Do the most flawlessly awesome work you can.**

As the saying goes, ""Treat others the way you would want to be treated"".

Ensure you are the sort of employee you would need working for you in the event that you were the boss. Imagine that you were running your own company, would you employ someone like you? Think about it. I know this is a major conflict to the execution of retribution and taking it all out on a line manager at any point conceivable. Regardless, by doing your very best in that situation is giving the unreasonable supervisor less bullets to shoot you with metaphorically speaking. He or she can potentially worsen your work conditions and make life completely unbearable. So do not attract unwarranted attention to yourself. Unless you have been singled out and the manager just has it out for you. There ought to be many other employees who can draw away his anger from you. Let another individual wear that target on their back.

**#3) Learn all that you can from an unreasonable boss.**

Every one we meet in life has something to teach us, either positive or negative. So we can effectively learn something from anyone that we come in contact with. While from a fairly good manager we can learn great administration procedures, likewise it is obvious that from a mediocre supervisor we can learn which mistakes to avoid. Don't simply endure, acquire something from each situation which will profit your later on in your career. As I indicated in my other article, growth is infinite. Which [mindset](https://www.inspiredboldlife.com/post/growth-mindset-insider-s-guide-to-growth-mindsets) you choose to take determines the end result. Pay attention to how your manager reacts to various problems and take note of his thought process. Give careful consideration of which methods worked and which fizzled.

**#4) Forget about yesterday.**

Yesterday is history, its over with. Make an effort not to let your issues from yesterday ruin today. Life is too short to hold onto senseless grudges. All things being equal, start every day with another, inspirational viewpoint, affirming to yourself that today will be better. You can read more about the power of positive affirmations [in this article](https://www.inspiredboldlife.com/post/why-positive-affirmations-will-change-your-life). Once in a while we position ourselves in situations where our actions become regrettable and we subliminally power an individual (in this situation our boss) to act in a manner which we naturally expect him to act. Make sure that you are accidentally throwing fuel into the fire. Beginning every day with a clean slate is the most ideal approach to move beyond past conflicts. Clutching onto resentment just damages yourself.

1,"I was always intimidated by stocks; it seemed like all the recipes had a bunch of ingredients, and they required some serious attention. Last year, my wife and I realized that's just not true. We started saving things in a gallon freezer bag. 

Whenever we use vegetables, we'll toss the skins, seeds, or whatever else we don't intend to use into our freezer bag. Something's on its last legs in the fridge but we don't have anything to use it in? In the bag! Bought a big pack of fresh spices like rosemary or thyme but only needed about 10% of it? In the bag! Whole chicken or other meat on the bone? Whatever we don't want goes in a different bag.

When the bag is full, we'll make stock. It's seriously a matter of tossing all of our unwanted vegetable scraps into a big pot, filling it with water, and then simmering it for a few hours. Strain it, portion it out, and freeze it. Boom, homemade stock that is easily as good as the stuff we used to pay $3.99/qt for. My chicken noodle soup, which requires 3 quarts of chicken stock, used to cost around $17-ish; now it's $5-ish. Not too shabby!

If you're interested, consider picking up two things: 

1. Cheesecloth or a handheld fine strainer - when making a bone stock, it's good to put it through a pasta strainer and then stick it in the refrigerator so the fat rises and congeals on top, but there are still going to be bits that you don't necessarily want. Put it through a fine strainer, and those bits don't get in your finished product.
2. Freezer molds - we got two molds that hold 4 1-cup portions. What's nice here is that we can freeze the stock and then put 8 cups into a big freezer bag, neatly organized. Then you can just pull exactly what you need, when you need it.",LPT: Love to cook and want to reduce waste? Try making stock. It's essentially free and way easier than you'd think.,116,21

Chances are one of you reading this is in a relationship that’s on the marriage track. If you’re thinking of proposing at a restaurant, DO IT BEFORE THE MEAL!

A few reasons:

-This is one meal you will *actually* never forget. Make your memory one in which both of you will enjoy and celebrate the entire time... instead of one person being a sweaty nervous wreck for 2 hours before the big moment.

-You can have more flattering pictures taken before you loosen the belt.

-It will fit the occasion perfectly to pop a bottle of champagne when your partner says yes (assuming they do). Champagne is almost always delicious, but much better at the start of a meal rather than before.

-Let’s say something goes wrong during the meal and you argue. Nothing relationship ending, but certainly not the perfect vibe for your special night. So you decide to postpone your proposal for another night (not too uncommon). Now you’ve racked up a large check without a proposal.  Less likely to go south if you start off both in a joyful, celebratory mood. Plus, if they say no, you can just leave. I promise the restaurant will understand.

Plus you might have other nearby tables but you drinks.

And of course, PLAN THIS OUT IN ADVANCE! Try to secure the table YOU WANT, have the staff ready to take pictures, pick out the champagne ahead of time so they can pop it immediately! You guys rock! You are perfect for each other! Have a great life!",LPT: Proposing at a restaurant? Do it BEFORE the meal instead of at dessert.,76,14

1,"TLDR: Most 403(b) plans are from predatory insurance companies and will end up costing you thousands of potential earned savings in the long run. **THESE COMPANIES RIPPING OFF K-12 TEACHERS AND OTHER NON-PROFIT SECTOR EMPLOYEES SHOULD BE ILLEGAL.**

*I am not a financial advisor and this advice is based off of my own experience.*

*For context, this 403(b) is in addition to my mandatory matched pension contribution.* 

I am 28 year old public high school teacher who has been contributing $100/check to an AXA/Equitable 403(b) since I started in 2015. It was pitched to me as a no-brainer investment and as a 22 year old with a decent amount of financial literacy I thought it sounded legit. I was always told from a young age to start saving for retirement as soon as you can with as much money as you can.

Today I decided I wanted to up my 403(b) contribution because I am trying to take control of my financial future. Well, before I logged on to change my contribution I Googled ""Equitable 403B reviews"" and 403(b)s in general. I quickly found resources from [The NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/your-money/403-b-retirement-plans-fees-teachers.html) to [ABC](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/403b-retirement-plan-advice-teachers/story?id=14453018) to a [non-profit website](https://403bwise.org) examining HOW BAD 403(B) ACCOUNTS USUALLY ARE. There is even a [specific resource dedicated to getting out of AXA/Equitable](https://403bwise.org/blog/entry/blog-guest-post-axa) because they are that bad!!!!

I am PISSED and I want to help stop others from investing in a 403(b) that could potentially harm their financial future.

If your employer matches your 403(b) contribution it is most likely a strong investment despite the fees (although I would encourage you to still look into it).

If your employer does NOT match your contribution, here is what you should do:

1. [Investigate your type of 403(b)](https://403bwise.org/education/vendor-search-tool). You are likely losing future earnings and don't know it (like me), but there's a chance your 403(b) is one of the few good ones. If your 403(b) is an insurance provider / annuity account I can almost guarantee you are being ripped off.
2. [If your 403(b) is from one of the companies to avoid](https://financeforteachers.com/how-to-choose-a-403b-vendor/) (scroll down the article), stop contributing immediately. For me it was as simple as logging in to a website and changing my contribution from $100 to $0 starting next pay check. *Note: there are more predatory companies than the ones on that list, do your research.*
3. If your school district / employer offers [a good 403(b) option](https://403bwise.org/education/bad-403b), see if you can move your current account to that one and start contributing either way.
4. Start contributing to a Roth IRA. Out of all the resources I looked at this was the advice always given. If you CAN contribute to a Roth IRA, do it and max it out every year even you have a good 403(b). I was already planning to open one this year, but now I'm contributing $0 to my 403(b) until I find a good one and putting the extra money into a Roth IRA.
5. If you still have money left to invest, investigate your options for your situation. Maybe your bad 403(b) is better than nothing despite the fees or maybe a traditional IRA on top of your Roth is best. Do some research for your situation and go from there.

If anyone else has advice or tips to add (or info I should edit) please let me know!

I am sick and tired of huge financial institutions taking advantage of vulnerable working class employees who are doing the best they can with what they have.

I just hope this post helps someone in the way all these resources helped me. The scariest part is that if I hadn't been proactive I would have lost tens of thousands of dollars of future earnings. The more aware people are of this, the better.","LPT: Your 403(b) retirement plan is probably ripping you off unless your employer is matching your contributions.

The good things in my life are my will to change, my dog, maybe living alone is not so bad, and I'm soon gonna get a camper van which has been a lifelong dream of mine.

Looking back, I don't know whether I was the cause of everything bad, or if things just got not matching with the person I am anymore (my girlfriend was great at the beginning, my friendship were fulfilling me up to a certain point, but still nothing is perfect..).

I feel guilty that everything is going down this direction, but might also be that it's a moment to go through the pain and realize that I might just need to open a new chapter of my life.

But things have to change, drastically, and I don't know where to start.

I just started therapy, so that's a plus, but I'd like to get further help either from the Reddit community, or from resources, or activities, that might do me good and help me find clarity.

If you think this is because, after all, no one wants to think about what is likely to injure us, make us sick, or even kill us, well, you'd be wrong. Our brains are wired to to constantly scan our environment for threats and hazards, and uncertainty in this domain only fuels anxiety and fear.

Bottom line, and contrary to popular belief, learning for example that COVID-19 is increasing your chance of death this month by say 30%, is a lot more useful than either (a) living with increased anxiety due to high uncertainty/ambiguity about it and overestimation of the risk, or (b) dismissing or underestimating the hazard and thereby making bad decisions and increasing your chances of getting sick, infecting others, or dying.

The surgery went very well and I recovered quickly, but it wasn't cheap and obviously going under the knife is not a great outcome.

1,"This is isn't meant to be a definitive and 100% working solution for headaches, as they can be caused by different factors (stress, sleeping too little or too much, or sometimes there's no known cause), but if you have an headache (especially if your head feels heavy or if you feel tired), it could be that you're just dehydrated. Try drinking a glass or two of water, wait half an hour, and see how it goes.

The science behind this is simple: our bodies must always have a balanced level of fluids. If you lose about 2% of your fluids, you might become thirsty. If you lose more than 5%, you might experience headaches, brain fog, or even see black dots. A fluid loss over 10% could give you cramps and convulsions, and more than 15% would probably lead to death.

I'm also speaking from experience, because when I was younger I used to drink no more than 1 or 2 glasses of water per day, and I often had headaches (sometimes they were as intense as when you eat ice cream too fast - ever tried that?). As soon as I started drinking more, I've been pretty much headache free.

Other than my own experience, I know a lot of people who don't drink water at all during the day (most of my colleagues don't bring water to the office and do their full 8 hours shift without drinking) and, guess what, they all have regular headaches. Some of them used to take ibuprofen or other NSAIDs every day, or even went to multiple doctors who simply prescribed them more drugs. When I suggested them to just drink some water, some laughed at me or said ""yeah, I wish it was that simple"", but I've managed to convince a couple of them and now they are feeling much better.

TLDR: if you suffer from headaches and don't drink much during the day, increasing your fluids intake may be beneficial to you.","LPT: if you have an headache, the solution may be as easy as drinking a glass of water",86,18

1,"Firstly: if you don't ask you don't get.

At your next review with your manager/boss - ask for a raise - ideally with a decent justification if possible.

See what their reaction is.

Even at companies who are doing well, budget timings and limits can still make it hard to reward staff.
If the company is doing bad, there won't be any spare cash.

So it's likely you'll get a ""I'd love to...but..&lt;money, etc&gt;"".

At that point ask if you can work something out in lieu of an increased salary.

Table the idea of going down to 4 days a week. 
At the same salary.

Although you shouldn't need to justify why, if you have a ""to spend more time with the kids/dependants"" / ""burnout"" / ""charity work"", line, use that to reinforce and help them have context and help sway a decision.

Then wait and see. 
Give whoever time to discuss and come back to you.

The worst that happens is that you get a 'No' - and nothing has changed. But you've planted the seed of a great idea and you can raise it again in the future as an option.

Obviously this works best if you're in a position where to deserve a raise and you're outperforming other staff on the same role as you.

Is this BS?
No, someone in one of my team's did this to me a few years ago. It was a great idea as I was limited on budget due to poor overall company performance - but he was smashing his work and deserved a raise. So we agreed to it.

Personally I keep an old jacket, an old pair of boots and a wool cap in my trunk just in case I get stuck in the cold when I’m not dressed warmly and need to walk somewhere for help. 

But the one that doesn’t get talked about enough is the tow strap. 

The most common accident in rural areas especially in the winter is for a car to end up in the ditch. Most times this is a very *minor* incident however, you’ll still spend $300 for a tow truck to come and tow you out. 

If you have a tow strap or rope, all you typically need is the help of a kind hearted friend or stranger with a 4WD pickup or SUV and as long as your car is still drivable they can get you out. 

*Important note; familiarize yourself with tow points on your vehicle. You shouldn’t just throw the tow strap on any piece of the frame you’re always best to tow by the manufacturers tow points. On some vehicles these are hidden under the bumper and require you to pop out a plastic cover and insert a threaded bolt with a hook on it.  It’s usually part of your spare tire kit in the trunk.*

*Second note: it is also legal in most jurisdictions to tow a vehicle a short distance using the aforementioned tow straps. It is not legal or advisable to take a vehicle on a busy/high speed road when you do not have power brakes or steering, however if it’s just a matter of towing it to the nearest mechanic or a friends driveway until you can get help, it’s safer than leaving you and your car on the side of the road.

So I used to work for a UK activity holiday company in Greece as a water sports instructor (Dinghy sailing, windsurfing and powerboating) when I was mid twenties. I had just finished a four day level 2 powerboat course with three middle aged guys who didn’t know each other at the beginning. 

They were actually really chill and had a good laugh doing the boat manoeuvres with them. They took the piss out of each other for letting their man over board dummy drown and so on which I enjoyed as it can be dry and awkward with some group dynamics. They were also able to be serious when it mattered. 

You could tell there was a friendly competitive rivalry to nail each manoeuvre which makes you look much better ask instructor as they naturally enjoy themselves more. 

The final day rolls around and I’m wrapping things up on a final debrief  in the late afternoon next to the beach bar and handing out certificates. It’s somewhat common to buy your instructor a beer on this day, if you finished a course with them and they enjoyed it. Seeing as we don’t get paid very much. However they’re about 6 euros  (7-8$) for guests so I don’t mind either way.

The quieter one right at the end pulls out his wallet “Well you know Joe I’ve had a great week with you and the guys so have a few beers on me”. Hands me 20 euro... wow that’s pretty generous. 

Immediately the other two guys grab out their wallets “Oh well of course I had a great time as well have a few on me”. I walked away with three 20 euro notes. 

I was left thinking “God damn man that was smooth and smart af and he totally read the other two, what a great guy.”

So I grabbed my buddy and we had many a beer that evening (At staff prices of course).

TLDR: Finished teaching a course with 3 guys on their holiday. One pulled out a 20 euro tip on the final day when he knew the others had their wallets so I would get triple the tip as they didn’t want to be the odd one out.

1,"This is counterintuitive for many people, so it's not as if this one will be 'ruined' by too many others understanding and using this tip.

Walk less than 100 yards and save 15 minutes of crawling up and down lanes that are tightly packed with people, and 15 minutes of waiting for an *opportunity* to back up and leave with your melting groceries.  Often, even 50 yards is good enough.  It's like nothing compared to walking up and down the aisles in a store.

'Near the door' is the worst spot in the parking lot.  The lanes of parking spots 'nearest' the door, just measuring horizontally from either side of the door are the next worst.  It's a time consuming pain in the buttocks to find a space, and to get into the space AND to get out of it again.

These parking spaces are densely populated by pedestrians with swinging purses, keys in hand, loose shopping carts, rampaging children and shitty drivers... so good luck keeping the dings and scratches off your shiny car.

Isn't it fun being made to wait because someone saw a spot they liked a lot, and decided to wait for someone else to unpack their groceries, return the cart and get into their car and pull out... only now this person is blocking them from leaving, and unable to back up because they're blocking all of those cars behind them too?  So what do they do?  They try to back up anyway, and expect everyone else to back up, too, and get violently enraged.

The parking lot hinterlands are practically no extra walking when you consider that inside the store you'll be going up and down aisles.  

There are usually great spots with shade/lighting or near a cart corral or security camera, that you can pull your vehicle into instantly, and leave instantly without backing up, and there are practically never any cars in them.  These become your 'reserved spots'!

If you're just grabbing something, you can park, walk to the store, get your things, pay, and walk back to your car before these 'competitors' can even park in their idiot bait spots.

There's no mob of car vandalizing fools who seem to want to die, crushed under your wheels.  You won't get stuck six deep behind an asshole who stops in the middle of the lane to wait for someone to pull out.  Security?  Someone walking out in a wide-open area to mess with your car is VERY obvious, compared to the convenient cover of having many surrounding vehicles.

Evil fun: Walk around the parking lot near the idiot bait spaces with your keys in your hand and a shopping bag, and bait crazy people into stopping and waiting for you to open your car.  Stop at a car, fumble your keys, then walk to a car on the opposite lane.  Toy with them.  Then, 'eureka' sign, and walk to the far end of the lot, where you really parked.",LPT: Park in the boondocks of the parking lot.,46,9

1,"**Left lane:** AKA the *passing* or *fast lane*. Used for passing slower vehicles driving in the middle lane, or at least supposed to be. The lane where people tend to speed and the lane for pickup trucks to tailgate you for no apparent reason. Jokes aside, DO NOT CLOG THE LEFT LANE. If the Dodge Ram behind you is tailgating or flashing their high beams at you, put your pride aside, do everyone a favor, get your ass back on the middle lane, and let them pass! Do not slow down to be petty and do not risk getting a ticket by speeding up to match their speed. It’s just not worth it and you’re doing nothing but disrupting the flow of traffic. Speeding is never okay but you’ll never know when a driver is going through a real emergency. Only use the left lane when passing (by 10-15mph.)


**Middle lane:** AKA the *cruising lane* or *through lane*. The lane that should be driven by default, the lane you want to be in if you want to have a smooth ride without having to worry about that Ford F-150 tailgating you, the safest lane for drivers new to the freeway, the lane for GPS users that don’t know where the hell they’re going, the lane where you’re least likely to get a ticket. Please.. don’t be a dick and speed in this sacred lane. 


**Right lane:** AKA the *lower speed through lane*. The lane for lower speed traffic, the lane where you prepare to exit the highway, the lane you drive in if you don’t feel comfortable matching the speed of the middle lane, the lane you DON’T use to pass others, the last lane you should be speeding in. When driving on the right lane, leave enough room in front of you for drivers on your left to pass you.

1,"Becoming angry, bitter or depressed because you are lonely is just slapping an emotional bandaid or bridge over the true emotions you're experiencing. If you can handle being any of these things, you can handle being lonely. 

Don't let yourself turn your loneliness into something that it isn't. Don't become angry at the world because you are lonely. Don't become depressed and blame your loneliness on yourself. Don't become jaded about life or other people because you are at a time in your life where you find yourself experiencing loneliness. 

Loneliness is like hunger or thirst. It may last longer than those but it is a craving for social or romantic interaction just like hunger is a craving for food. And just like when you're hungry, you just need to sit with your cravings until they subside, go away or you find a way to sate them. 

But getting angry, depressed, bitter never got you a meal any faster and loneliness is the same way. And as anyone who has gone hungry can tell you, it won't kill you. It's just one state of being between other states of being. 

Getting used to being alone and comfortable with how it feels, rather than reacting to loneliness with other negative states of being, makes the experience much more easy to bear.
