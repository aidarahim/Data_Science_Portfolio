I worked at a bank once l and was contacted by an old HS buddy about pulling off a credit card scam. Guy says all I need to do is process a cash advance for $X000, using a dummy card that one of his pals would stop into the branch with and we’d split our “profit” evenly. Admittedly, his scheme sounded tempting at first, especially after hearing him say there’d be minimal risk involved on my end since I was relatively new at the bank.

As much as I could’ve used the extra cash, I declined because I felt uneasy and instinctively it felt wrong. I weighed the pros and cons and decided against it, realizing he wasn’t putting himself at any risk and obviously taking advantage of my position. He seemed disappointed and said things that made me feel like a bit of a coward for not going along with it.

Fast forward a few months down the line, I find out another guy he approached winds up getting caught for credit card fraud and not only lost his job, but was blackballed by the bank he worked for.

LifeProTips,"What you're expecting of people in poverty is to overcome a set of conditions that are much more difficult, under more extreme circumstances of stress, with much more at stake (their life and wellbeing) with much less at their disposal. 

Poverty is a constant and is not solved by shifting some material conditions around.

If you want people to overcome it you can empower them through giving them the means to overcome it. I understand that. Yet the folly is in the belief that these means are obtainable simply through the process of pointing them out. 

&amp;#x200B;

People know saving exists. You can't save if you don't have money to save. 

People know that moving somewhere else exists. The economy is reactive. Cost of living is proportional to wages and comes with many other considerations. If it was viable, they would do it. 

The poor are already incredibly frugal, but not by choice. Again I'm citing the reactivity of the economy. Frugality isn't something that is only actioned by the poor. Competition works on a diminishing scale also. If something is cheap and many people want it, eventually it will not be cheap or it will be harder to gain access to it. Look at shin and rib-cuts of beef that used to be considered poverty meat, but now because of the restaurants utilising them, they're not as cheap. 

Vegetables are cheap but they don't comprise a full diet. You're not circumventing the pitfalls of poverty if you only eat vegetables. You're  shifting the issue. You need fats and protein. They're are often unobtainable in healthy forms for people living in poverty.

The frighteningly low expectations of people in poverty is bigotry. We're not talking high-school level knowledge that some people reasonably might not have. You're  talking down  as if they lack basic reading comprehension, object permeance and any lucidity in examining the reality of their situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

The irony is it costs nothing for people with money to show concern for peoples wellbeing. If somebody is poor don't rationalise it away, consider what it actually takes to solve the issues relating to the wellbeing of people who're poor. Maybe you'll find a creative and yet untapped solution that has been staring you in the face. If it's on the level of 'save more money' though then I imagine you wont have very much to offer.","LPT: The poor are already experts in having no money.

LifeProTips,"Self-worth comes from knowing and understanding your higher values and desires and how they translate to specific needs you have. 

Boundaries help us to delineate and communicate our needs to others clearly and set the conditions for what we are a ""yes"" to and open and receptive to experiencing, and where we are closed and a firm ""no.""

 Needs can vary from the most basic self-care, such as having access to food, shelter, healthcare, and monetary resources, to more complex needs like wanting to feel heard, valued, or understood by others. 

For example, maybe you have a specific preference for the way you would like your significant other to show up in relationship with you. 

Perhaps, you've learned that you feel more connected and valued by your significant other, friend, family member, or roommate if they consistently take out the trash or clean up after themselves?

Maybe, over the years, you've discovered that you feel more trust in your relationships with your friends or partners if they make a consistent effort to text and call you to see how you are doing?

We can also have even deeper needs that may arise. We could feel a need and a strong desire to feel connected to a deeper sense of purpose or creativity. 

We may be in touch with the yearning to feel like we have the freedom to be ourselves and follow our passions, which translates to the need to freely express yourself to others or feel supported by those around you to do what you most love to do. 

Understanding what our higher values and desires are is the first step. The second step is to become present with our higher values and desires and how they translate to specific needs we have. 

By meeting our own needs, we then learn how to translate them into the expression of the boundaries that support us in knowing the specific conditions that support us in connecting with our higher values and personal truths. 

The clearer we are around our needs, values, and boundaries, the less guesswork we leave for other people when we lean into connection and relationship with them. The less guesswork there is, the more room there is for greater intimacy, trust, clear communication, and connection. 

Through learning to wholly value, honor, and respect yourself, you invite others to do the same and create the foundation through which others can deeply honor and meet you in the ways you are most worthy and deserving of.","LPT: Neglecting your needs and boundaries in relationship reinforces the belief that you aren't worthy of being honored in the way you truly deserve.

LifeProTips,"TLDR: Income-Based Repayment plans may make your loan payments higher for the life of your loans without saving you money or payments in the long run. Find out how much standard repayment plan payments are. You can pay the lower minimum, then pay more on the highest interest loans to save money.

More detail:
I kept getting calls each year from my loan servicer, Sallie Mae, to renew my income-based repayment (IBR) plan. I assumed for a long time that this was my best option. In fact, it was far from it. On about 30k in loans, the IBR had my minimum payment at over $300.

Finally, I asked myself ""why are they so eager to help me save money?"" What I found out is that the way they allocate payments on a ""standard"" repayment schedule keeps the payments about the same over the life of the repayment. And yet somehow, it was not actually paying my loans off any sooner on the IBR. 

This time around, I refused the IBR, and my monthly payments went down to about $125 a month. I had been paying that plus a bit towards the few low-balance (almost gone) loans before the COVID forbearance came into play. When I start repaying again, I will focus on the highest balance loans, which are also the highest interest rate.

Point being you can save a lot more money by controlling how you pay off your loans to pay off the highest interest rate loans first. You could also refinance your high-interest loans, but you will lose key features like forbearance.","LPT: Student Loan ""income based repayment"" plans often increase your minimum monthly payments"

I saw this phrase in passing one time and never thought much of it until I was moving away from a place that I had come to love and had grown immensely as a person while living there. I was only able to move away to pursue bigger things as a result of this personal growth. 

Anyway, the night before I moved I was feeling sad that I had to leave, and I remembered: take a moment to say thank you and goodbye. I went out to the balcony overlooking the city and started saying thank you. To my first job for teaching me not to be pushed around. To my asshole boss for teaching me how to stand up for myself. To the old basement I had moved into when I first got there for teaching me to not settle. To myself for growing up. And then I said goodbye to it all. 

That moment right there gave me so much closure and security in moving on. I'm sure even now I would be broken up about having to leave were it not for that moment that made it okay to leave. Now I feel at peace remembering that place and all I remember were the good times that helped me grow.

LifeProTips,"To become a better cook, don’t rely on the estimated time a dish is supposed to cook. Instead, start a timer from zero counting upwards, and then taste/touch/observe the dish at various times, only checking the clock AFTER you’ve assessed the dish. This helps your sense of time while cooking, and will show you different stages of “doneness” for various food flavors &amp; textures, especially with meats, grains, baked goods, etc.

For example, when cooking muffins, start a timer counting up from 00:00 when you put them in the oven. Start checking the muffins EARLY (like, at 8 min), just by LOOKING at them or touching them lightly (obviously keep the oven-opening to a minimum). After you’ve assessed them, THEN check the timer to see how much time has passed. Batter still jiggly at 10 min? Check them in a few more min. Batter comes off on your finger when lightly touching the tops? Check them again in a few min. Do they bounce back? They’re done! For baking especially, the recipe might *say* they’ll be done in 25 min, but in reality they might be perfect at 15 min. 

It drives me nuts when a friend or family member pops something in the oven and immediately sets the timer for the exact ‘cooking time’ and never looks on or checks the food until the timer goes off. OR when they only allow a 5 min window for error. Don’t be that person. Build a relationship with your food, check on it often, it will turn out much better in the long run.

TLDR: Ignore suggested cooking times and keep time on your own by checking on your food often. Nobody likes hockey-puck muffins or mushy overcooked rice.","LPT: Learning to cook?

My job:

Hi, I've been working at this company for around 4 months now. What we do is fill up bottles with product and twist the bottlecap into place all day, thousands of bottles a day filled and capped everyday. It's very simple work, but it does take some skill to be fast. The job is basically all about speed, which I already have down. Supervisors can trust me to get the work they ask of me done.

The controversy:

So we just started working overtime (53 hours a week with 1 day off a week) because we need to get a bunch of bottles ready for the holidays. The company has been trying to hire more people to help us out. We hired a new girl and me and at least 2 other coworkers found out that she's making more money an hour than us, I think its 1 dollar more per hour as one coworker told me, but she told me she's making 75 cents more, either way though she's still making more money for doing the same exact job as us, but being worse at it due to her being new. Speaking about being worse at a job, I also found out myself that another coworker is making more than us (75 cents more than me), and he started working here about a month after me. So not only is he newer as well but he is actually worse at the job as well, and just got talked to by management about being slow (this is all coming from him speaking to me as well).

How we feel:

We were never given a 3 month review for a raise or anything of the sort, this whole time I guess we just thought we would be stuck at our hired wage and a raise would be hard to come by. All 3 of us, and more coworkers I know which deserve the money more, are all good workers. We're not troublemakers or anything, we show up for work, work, then go home. We think this is very unfair and is a legitimate issue. Especially because one of the coworkers who knows about this has an ill mother, which he's spending lots of money on expensive caretakers since he can't be there to help due to a strict mandatory overtime, management knows about his situation as well. I know that money would be really helpful for him and his family.

What do we do?

So how should my 2 other coworkers and I handle this? I was personally thinking that we should rally together other good working coworkers who deserve the money more, and we'll all setup a meeting with one of our supervisors/managers and talk about this. See if there's even a valid reason, which I don't believe there is one, as to why this would happen. We will obviously demand that we all be paid the same as someone who has only been working here for a week. Should we also demand that we receive some type of bonus for the amount of time this has been going on?

Conclusion:

So what should we do? What shouldn't we do? Is there something else we didn't think of that we should do instead. So yeah that's about it, I wanna make sure we do this right, I'd appreciate any help","LPT Controversial workplace situation, what should we do?"

LifeProTips,"I just turned 40 and was still biting my nails many times every hour. I catch myself biting them all the time without thinking about it. It became a 30 plus year habit that I have tried to break many, many times. I understand that the habit includes the hand-to-mouth movement, which could also include smoking, which I did for many years and still did before I stopped biting my nails. So this may help those that do both!

So I tried everything to stop over decades. I tried manicures... Many of them, thinking that if they look good and I just spent money to make them look good, that I would stop. This always worked for a short period of time. Never worked for more than 6 weeks, and I always went back to biting them. I put bad tasting polish on my nails, which also never worked for me. I tried to write down every time I caught myself biting them, but this lasted for like a day or two. I always repeated the same things, but expected a different result. Insanity is what that was.

So instead of trying the same things, I decided that I needed to change that habit completely. I decided to get fake nails put on over my nasty, short, bloody at times nails. Yeah, I am a guy and I had a nail place put fake nails over my own. They looked at me weird and it felt a little uncomfortable, but I knew I had to try something new. When I asked them to make the nails short, so they are a good length, they thought that was weird too. I guess they wanted me to have them long, but I was going for the whole ""looking like they are my real nails"" look. The process took about an hour and didn't cost too much, like 50 bucks. Ok, so on my way I went.

Fake nails are a little weird to me. I tried bitting them, but it just wasn't the same as biting my real nails. My real nails would have rough tops, dents and slivers that kelp me wanting to bite them. The fake nails were smooth and hard. Biting them wasn't the same at all. I did still pick them a lot, especially in the beginning, but after 8 weeks of having them on, that habit went away too.

During my 8 weeks of fake nails, I discovered that I have a new super power! I can open cans, get out knots, peal off stickers, scratch myself (sometimes too much, so be careful), scratch my cat, who really loved the fake nails! This new super power was awesome! It is like having a 6th sense. For real! This was awesome!

I will say that during the 8 weeks of fake nails, I had to go to the nail salon twice to ""fill-in"" the fake nails, but this was like 20 bucks each or so. Not bad.

So after 8 weeks, I got my nails off and wow, the real ones look amazing! And it has not been 2 weeks with my real ones and I love it! Just a precaution... Once the fake nails are off, your real nails will not be up to normal strength yet. I mean, we have been biting them for years, or decades in my case! Put some nail hardener on for a few weeks and if you are a guy and want the nails to look real and not shiny, just get some Clear Matte Top Coat polish and apply. Or ask for that at the salon. Your nails will look like they have no polish on them at all. I even used the Clear Matte polish with the fake nails and they looked real.

I discovered that during my time with the fake nails, my smoking habit reduced considerably, from 15 a day to 2 or 3. I used this decrease as an opportunity to stop smoking all together and now I just vape here and there if I want to smoke. I bet the elimination of Nail Biting reduced my need to smoke, likely due to the hand-to-mouth habit I have had for years.

So in summary... I was able to stop my 30-plus year habit of biting my nails for under $100 in about 8 weeks. Fake nails and Clear Matte polish did the trick. Biting fake nails just doesn't give me the same satisfaction as biting my real nails. If you can't stop biting, give this a shot and let me know if it works for you.

I would love to hear about your experiences as well... Leave a comment or message me if you want more details or insight into how I finally stopped.","LPT - After 30 years of biting my nails, I finally found a way to stop!"

Then when you need a quick meal, cook up your favorite carb and mix in one of the sauces you've saved. 

Slow cooker sauce leftovers have all the best stuff, flavors, fats and bits of whatever they cooked. 

Over time you'll start saving more things in these containers. If theres a couple bites of taco meat left over these days I'll throw it in a container. Scrape the spaghetti sauce pan into one. Extra sauce from the Thai place, throw it in a container

You can either throw the sauce and stuff in the microwave (not in the plastic though) and mix in your cooked and drained noodles/rice, or just drain your noodles and heat the sauce in the pot  

This is my favorite late-night snack. Boil a pack of ramen, mix in a thing of sauce, maybe a thing of meat, or throw some cheese on top. Sometimes its basically spaghetti, sometimes its a really good sauce from a slow cooker meal a month ago, sometimes I'll fry up an egg and mix it in.

This might seem obvious to some, but it's been a months long struggle at my house for a guy who knows very little about electrical/appliances. Old dryer stopped getting hot, replaced the heating element and thermostat... Still didn't work. Ok, bought a used (but still old) dryer and it worked for about a week before it stopped getting hot too. Uggghh. Fine, maybe the used one we got was junk. Gave up and bought a brand new washer and dryer with professional install and guess what? Dryer didn't get hot, right from the start. WTF? Ok, so obviously it's an electric problem right? Tested the outlet with a meter and it's getting full 220V, just like it's supposed to. Checked breakers, everything is good. We're now months into not having clean laundry and about to spend a fortune to have an electrician come out... Until a buried Google search suggested that a 220 outlet can test fine but not get enough once a load is put on it. On a whim I went ahead and replaced the outlet and bam! Everything is beautiful. Three months and countless headaches (not to mention money spent on new appliances) was all fixed by a $5 outlet replacement.","LPT: If your dryer isn't getting hot, and the dryer and outlet each test fine, try replacing the outlet before spending a fortune on anything else"

LifeProTips,"It’s no secret that habit building can be hard. I’m constantly experimenting with ways to make adoption of better habits a little more seamless for myself. And then, I was introduced to a concept called habit stacking.

Habit Stacking follows the principle that it’s always easier to practice new habits by attaching them to the tail-end of an existing one. This is formula that you have to bear in mind:

After \[CURRENT HABIT\],

I will \[NEW Habit\]

You’re essentially taking your willpower out of the equation by following a routine of practices, and can even have stacks on top of stack, If you prefer. It leveraged the power of using a routine to add on new habits and follow it through muscle memory. For example:

After I wake up in the morning, I meditate for 15 minute.

After I meditate for 15 minutes, I workout for an hour.

After I workout for an hour, I handle email and other tasks.

This has even been discussed by James Clear in his bestseller *Atomic Habits* and explains that this is a great way of tapping into the way that our neurons and brain in programmed. I explain this in depth here with examples - [https://youtu.be/7yTQPPW3cQE](https://youtu.be/7yTQPPW3cQE).

LifeProTips,"Hey! Not sure how much of an LPT this is, but I’ve been using this method for a few years now because a manager of mine recommended it.

Basically, I used to have one bank account and would just spend recklessly and then scramble at the end of the month to pay my bills, and basically not be able to use one whole paycheck and have to wait a week or two before my next to do anything.

What I have done is make two bank accounts. One is linked to all my bills as automatic payments. The other is meant for spending without any regard for bills. The key is to get a general balance of what you owe to bills in a month’s time and divide that by how many times you get paid in a month. Then, take that amount from each check and deposit it into your bills bank account. That way, by the end of the month, all the money for your bills should be present, and you can still spend money weekly.

It’s best to use automatic withdrawals and settings with this, in case you forget.

*Example: If I pay about $900 in bills monthly, and I get paid twice a month, then each paycheck should automatically remove $450 from my general spending account and deposit it into my bills bank account where the bills will be deducted from.*

———

I have found that the bank, Simple, works really well as my primary spending account, and then my bills account could be any local Credit Union in my area because they shouldn’t have any fees and a very low minimum to open and keep an account active.

To take it a step even further, Simple has a great system to withdraw money daily from your account and save it without you even noticing. I’ve been able to save $400 monthly without doing a thing but creating the withdrawal setting.

LifeProTips,"Inspired by seeing some comments in some subs here that focus on one side or the other of an argument, where the commenter ""went to \*the sub on the other side\* to read up on why they think the way they do"". 

Doing that provides some insight, sure. But that insight is only about *the people that are involved in that social media outlet,* not about everyone who supports the other side of the issue. You only get the trends from people who are actively posting to it or voting on it, and it completely leaves out the large segment of the population that doesn't use that channel.   


So what you often end up getting is a view of the ""loud"" part of the other side of the argument. And that's often upvoted because it's clever or edgy more than because it gives a fair representation of what everyone on the other side is thinking.   


There's an age distribution issue as well because different social media platforms are used by different age groups. Facebook's generally older; Reddit's probably more toward a younger crew.

1) Some scissors exist for specific uses and if you’re doing things like sewing or other crafts frequently, it is generally a good idea to invest in a good pair made for that activity. Normal scissors will get dull very quickly when cutting fabric and threads while a pair of sewing scissors for example, won’t get damage from those things and can be sharpened easily if used as intended which brings me to my next point 

2) Dedicate a pair of scissors for cutting things like tape and maybe label them too! Tape (especially duct tape) leaves a gooey residue on blades after a while so to avoid that fate, set aside specific craft scissors for the job. It’ll save you a lot of frustration and money!

3) Make it known to housemates (roommates, spouses, etc) that they shouldn’t be cutting paper, tape, or cardboard with “the fancy scissors” if those are lying around, and that if they need to cut something, get the appropriate pair.

Get yourself a good cookbook, something for someone just starting to cook. Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution is fantastic for this - it is designed to get you cooking simple, tasty meals you can make any time.  

Buy some basic kitchen equipment - nothing fancy or special: one large sauce pan, a small nonstick skillet, assorted wooden spoons, a whisk, a few spatulas, a good large pot, a collander or strainer. 

Pay attention to what you like if you eat out or order in, or when others cook. Start savoring your food - pay attention to salt levels in your food. Note the sweetness or bitterness on food.  Eat slower so you can learn about tastes.  Talk about food to others. If eating with others, comment on what you like or don't like about a dish. This gets you thinking about how food is prepared.  

Commit to making a handful of meals each week. Learn basics, like how to fry or scramble eggs; how to make rice; how to make a basic pasta sauce; how to stir fry vegetables; how to oven roasted veggies or potatoes. Write our your food menu for the week and plan those meals - it doesn't have to be every meal. Just do it for two or three meals each week. 

Do these things and you'll build your skillset, your vocabulary, and your appreciation of food. Soon you'll find yourself exploring more, looking for new flavors or dishes.  This is the path to becoming a cook and enriching your life with food you love.whwn you start cooking for yourself, you'll begin to appreciate food more.

LifeProTips," In life, we are presented with many different choices and find ourselves at numerous crossroads. There will be many moments that we may feel uncertain about what specific direction to take or if we are making the right choice. In a lot of instances, having to make a certain choice can feel like life or death. 

If the choice is particularly emotionally charged for us, we aren’t going to be able to access a clear answer from within ourselves from that activated state. Making certain choices can evoke strong emotional reactions like fear, anxiety, stress, overwhelm, anger, and grief. 

When we feel strong emotions such as these, our nervous system is getting overloaded, and we aren’t able to think or reason clearly or have clarity around how we are actually feeling. 

When we feel emotionally overwhelmed or confused, we also lose access to discern the difference between what yes and no feels like in our bodies. To discern a clear yes or no, we need to be able to reconnect with ourselves in the present moment beyond the story of what we think is happening. 

Regardless of whether we are being confronted with an amazing opportunity or negotiating a challenging decision, when we are faced with an unknown variable, our animal brain and limbic system can perceive the unknown variable as threatening. We need to be able to calm the animal brain and the part that feels threatened before we can move forward. 

If you are ever feeling unsure about how you feel around a particular choice you need to make, one way to quickly re-establish a connection with yourself in the present moment is to make contact with your body. 

You might put a hand on your heart and another on your belly and bring awareness to the in and outflow of your breath. You can also try bending your knees and dropping your weight into your feet while expanding your awareness to sense into the exact places that your feet are making contact with the floor. 

Taking the time to slow down with ourselves in this way has the benefit of discharging the activation in our nervous system so that all of our faculties are online and we feel resourced before we make a choice. 

Accessing a clear yes or no won’t be possible from a place of overwhelm or activation. 

Finding your own sense of inner balance and homeostasis can help create clarity and internal coherence in your nervous system so you can respond from a place of being fully connected to yourself and present moment truth without any confusion.","LPT: A maybe is a no until proven otherwise.

LifeProTips,"In college, I started going out (or ordering in) with friends and we would often take turns putting it on one card and the others would pay cash or send via Venmo, Cash App, etc..., I also experienced things like splitting utilities costs, groceries, etc... for the first time too. 

If you’re in a situation where somebody gives you a $20 for a $19.99 meal, but with taxes and tip you’ll be shorted a bit, show them the bill before they get the money out. Bonus points for saying something like “our meals were each 19.99, total with tip is $50.” I’ve always gotten my friend’s fair shares with this method, and I don’t have to feel awkward asking for $3. 

I felt so weird saying “hey could you send/give me a few more bucks” because I was afraid of the response “it’s only $3 it’s not a big deal.” But this happened often enough to where it can add up, especially if you always help pay your part when somebody else is buying. 

This doesn’t only apply in person either! E.g, If utilities are in your name and the bill is $103.64, just screenshot the bank charge and send it to your roommates. Sending requests on money transferring apps is a great method too, but not when people pay cash.

LifeProTips,"There are numerous channels on YT that already promote this, but I'll speak from experience.

Wether you want to lose weight, get bulkier, learn a new skill, a new language, adopt a habit... you name it - slowly, but steady is the way to go.

I speak fluent English and my German is flawed, currently I can understand most of Italians. There are people that have a knack for languages, but if you're looking to learn a new language: go steady. 

Every day, learn 10 new words (maybe 15 when starting out). Make sure to actually learn them. The next day, gloss over what you have done before after learning 10 new words to see how well you have learned them. Of course there is a lot more to learning a new language, but that you should research yourself or look for a more professional guide.

If you're trying to lose weight and you're not really in a hurry, set a goal of a pond or even half a pound a week. This way, you don't stress yourself out while on the diet and if you accidentally don't meet the required goal, just move it to the next week or even forget that week. 

The reason why this method works is because it doesn't put much stress on you. You can go about your daily life as usual, and these few things take up only a small portion of your day, yet the time flies by so fast, you really will be surprised at the results.

Another important thing to rememberis to not overestimate yourself. Youm may be looking to lose weight and think ""I could lose even a kilogram a week, not just a measly pound"". The first week or 2, sure, some could pullit off with relative ease, but it tires you quickly after that. When you see you can't keep up with the schedule, lower you requirements. Keep it nice and steady. 

Tl;Dr; You should go slowly and patiently about learning or doing anything new (as listed in the 2nd pragraph). Don't overestimate yourself, and don't be afraid to slow down. Don't stop, just slow down.",LPT: Doing life slowly really is a way to go.

LifeProTips,"Preface - I work in the environmental field and came into a compliance group working as a scientist with an asbestos background. I've been with the company for 4 months. 

They hired me specifically for this reason, as I could do asbestos work and go onto asbestos sites. 

I was told by two separate doctors that I should transition out of the field due to health concerns. 

I vocalized this to my manager (thinking I would be let go) and she opened upwith additional options within the company. Transitioning to compliance and other fields. This sounds really boring and too good to be true.

I'm 25 and eager to have an exciting career. I realized my field is lots of hazardous work and am looking to move out of it. 

I've considered joining the AirForce and becoming a pilot. This has been at the forefront of my mind recently. I'm willing to learn and this would be a life long career option with plenty of perks. I'm willing to put the time and effort in. 

I've also considered laying low for a while, out of the workforce because of how weird things have been. I'm single (just out of a long term relationship) and not ready to jump at anything that comes by just because it's a job. 

Financially I'm pretty secure and still live at home. I do pay student loans back and for car insurance. 

I really want to make a career move that will set me up for a life of fun, learning and growth. I'd like to be able to support myself (including my existing family) because my mom is older and retiring in a few years. She didn't plan well and will have to be taken care of by probably all of us to some extent (4 of us in the family). 

My older brother currently pays the mortgage on the house we all live in (there's 7 of us in it) and I want to help the family long term but also consider what's best for me.

I know the manager has future work lined up in this field, because she mentioned it, but I'm not the guy for the jobs anymore. She mentioned how it would make her look to the clients as well.

She did try to get me to do work that I wasn't licensed for in another state because it was cheaper and easier for me to do it.

 know at the end of the day the company is looking out for itself. They don't want to let me go because they don't want to pay me out and rather me quit. 

Do I stay with the company because they have other options or stick with my initial gut feeling of leaving?

The groups expand and collapse on clicking, and can be assigned names and color codes. For instance, a tab group named 'work' may contain all the work-related tabs like emails or client webpages. A group called 'social' can consist of all the social media tabs. And so on.

Yes, belive it or not there are such things. But wait, there is more ! The stick like looking object beside the steering wheel is the turn signals switch. It is the part of a turn-signal system by which the vehicle operator causes the signal lamps to function. And you know what, when you use these turn signals other drivers know what are going to do.

Then for fun I asked to listen to BBC Radio 4, because I had heard of that one time, and it worked as well. So you should know that many many radio stations are available to listen to on smart speakers. I recently looked up the BBC radio stations, because I was wondering what made BBC Radio 4 was exactly. Here's what wikipedia had to say:

* BBC Radio 1 – youth oriented, mostly contemporary pop and rock music (including Top 40 singles), plus news, original in-house live music sessions, original live music concerts and music documentaries.

* BBC Radio 2 – the network's flagship station broadcasts adult oriented entertainment, wide range of music—specially adult contemporary and middle of the road, also talk, comedy, plus news, original in-house live music sessions, original live music concerts and music documentaries.

 * BBC Radio 3 – arts and high culture, special-interest music (classical, jazz, world music), plus news, original in-house live music sessions, original live music concerts and music documentaries.

 * BBC Radio 4 – news, current affairs, arts, history, original in-house drama, original in-house first-run comedy, science, books and religion. The service closes down and simulcasts the BBC World Service from 01:00 to 05:20 daily.

 * BBC Radio 5 Live – news, sports and talk programme

Oh man, now that I'm looking closer at that wikipedia article, I see there are many more stations. BBC 1-6 Extra, BBC Asia, BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Radio Ulster from Northern Ireland

LifeProTips,"I was just remembering how hard it was for me to talk to people and socialize in general. And how along the way I learned how to overcome it. Not only it , but to improve every life aspect: Smiling.


When you approach someone, smile. That will break the ice instantly and give you confidence, while at the same time lowering the natural defenses of the other person and earning his/her attention more easily.


While in a conversation, smile. This will tell your brain that you're not in a danger situation. Yeah, our brains can do that. That will communicate to the other person that you're connected. That you are at ease and appreciating the conversation. Things will be much easier.


When giving a talk, for dozens or hundreds of people, smile all the way. Your shyness and lack of confidence will be obliterated by it. Your true self will surface and your fabricated persona will vanish.


When asking for information, smile. The other person will be much more helpful to you.


When asking for a favor. Smile for the same reason.


When in a date with a person that you're interested in: Smile. This should be obvious. Yeah. But I'm talking about a genuine smile. If you're nervous, it will go away. You'll be more confident and able to express more of yourself.
Even if things don't work out, you'll create a good connection to the person, and win a friend.


If you're feeling bad, or stressed, or distressed in any way. Smile. You will instantly feel better.


Summing up: When you smile, you create a strong and genuine connection, emotional connection, between you and anyone else that you're interacting with. It breaks barriers. It creates connections between you and yourself as well. Who you really are. It opens up things that are closed. Undoes knots. It's a powerful thing.",LPT: My most powerful Life Hack

LifeProTips,"I've been learning a lot about the game poker lately as a hobby during lockdown. At first, it was just a fun time killer, but lately, it's been changing the way I think about life and my decisions.

The key thing I've learned is the importance of **expected value** to long-term results. You can call a pre-flop all-in with 7-2 offsuit (the worst hand in poker), and win 12.5% of the time. Does that make it a good move from an expected value standpoint (plus EV)? Not unless your price to call is 1/8th or less the size of the pot that already exists. Now if you're the guy with Aces and you call, and you lose, that doesn't mean you made a bad decision. You're still taking their money 87.5% of the time.

You shouldn't judge yourself for losing that hand, just like you shouldn't judge yourself for making good decisions in life that turn out bad. You can do everything right, and still fail. Luck plays a massive role in success in life. And while you can create better outcomes and create a bigger edge through skill in life than poker, the role of luck is a lot higher than most people think.

Conversely, you shouldn't think better of yourself if you ""suck out"" (a poker expression about winning with an inferior hand) and win with an awful hand, just like you shouldn't get too high on yourself in life if a bad decision works out perfectly for you. You certainly shouldn't use that as a reason to continue to make bad decisions in your life.

**Ex**: I had a debate with a friend over what type of advice to give to college freshmen. I was saying they should take lots of time before college to pick what career they want and what major will get them there. I hadn't, yet somehow I stumbled into success and wanted to encourage younger people to take a more active role in shaping their destiny. My friend argued that people should just go into college, take out that debt, and figure it out as they go. He used how it worked out for me as proof of his argument. However, thinking about it from an EV standpoint, I still had made a bad decision. I was taking out debt &amp; using up using 4 years of my life where I could be earning money, to get a degree I had no idea how I would use. I sucked out on life by getting to the level of success I'm at today and in probably 80 of the parallel universes where I made the same decision, I failed and wasted a lot of time and money.

Conversely, if you made the decision to go to college and study and a STEM field, got good grades, networked, etc... and couldn't find a job because the economy went to shit. That's not your fault. Don't blame yourself. Most times you put in those same inputs, you'd get better outcomes. Look for the next smart input to make to get yourself better outcomes in the long-run. Don't let it affect your future decision making.

Also, if you are successful, take some time to acknowledge ways that you've been lucky to get to this point.  This will keep you humble and grounded, and let you more fairly interact with those currently less successful than you.

**I'm not saying don't think critically about your inputs, and what is and isn't working for you.** Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Just look at the decisions you make in life from an expected value perspective, and consider the role of chance in the results you get from them. Not make too drastic of changes (or advice others too), based exclusively on how well it didn't or did work for you. You could be leading yourself to make decisions that will have consequences in the future, or keeping yourself from going down a good path.","LPT: Judge Yourself By Your Inputs, Not Your Outcomes"

LifeProTips,"The mass exodus of California is what sparked this thought. With prices to go cross country upwards of $5,000 or more, getting even the lowest cost membership with AAA can save you 12% on the cost of a rental. Having said that, the AAA discount isn't always advertised, so consider asking the rental location if you already have AAA.

This is not an advertisement for Penske or AAA, I just want to help people on their hyper expensive trips out of the state. There are sometimes cheaper alternatives like Budget and U-Haul, but with the lack of availability of vehicles in California, all can be quite expensive.

Bonus, Penske offers unlimited miles on One-Way Rentals (picking up at a location and dropping it off somewhere else). So you can pick a truck up in a different state, come to California, load your vehicle and then take it to your destination. We have customers do this all the time, picking up in Arizona and dropping off on the east coast. It can be a difference of thousands of dollars. Even with the cost of gas for the extra miles, it can be worth it to some people.

Their argument for why the questions are OK is that they aren't telling you it's true, they're asking you what you'd think if it was. Basically, it's a way of lying to you without getting in trouble for lying. They also know that the more you hear a lie, the more you'll believe it (even if you know it's a lie).

I see this a lot from people, and I mean a lot, in person, online, etc. When someone does wrong and they look different, it makes tones of people think they can make fun of or insult their appearance. 

This gives the connatation that being ugly= a bad person at very young age. I know kids who hurt themselves because they deem themselves to be ugly. Especially on social media. The kids see it and think it's normal, im very young, I see people do it all the time. I see people just tearing eatch other down because they deem eatch other as bad, so they have no problem body shaming. And I emphasized the word 'deem' you can be a good person to one eye but a bad to another

To me body shaming is body regardless of who you do it to. im dark skin, have the same reaction to another physical characteristic.

A good example was way way back, I can't remember but there was this guy who was falsely accused of being a rapist. I remember a tones of memes of him that were insulting his looks, comments calling him ugly, etc. When they found out he was innocent, No one deleted anything, nobody made an apology, those memes are probably still up there. Sadly the guy committed suicide...I think, I just remember he had tones of mental health problems and suicide attempts.

It's a very barbaric thing to insult people appearance. When it has nothing to do with situations. I get jokes, but when the punchline is to degrade your looks all the time, it starts to feel wrong.

If it’s possible (and when it’s safe) for you to substitute commuting with public transport, seriously consider dropping the car.

LifeProTips,"Most of this advise applies only applies when it’s safe to take public transport and many living and work situations require car ownership. I’m speaking from the perspective of a 20 something living in a big city in the US.

Most of my friends own a car, and I feel that it’s like it’s largely an unnecessary expense for them. Car’s cost a lot of money, not just in the upfront cost or loan, but in expenses like repairs, gas, and parking.

LifeProTips,"Most people, including myself until recently, belive scholarships are set in stone after you apply for them. However, the reality is if you talk to admissions they can get you more money. If you simply tell them you are unsure and mention other schools and what they have offered you (always apply to a safety school for this reason b/c they will offer you more money which you can leverage) they may offer you additional money from their discretionary scholarship money. All schools keep some money set aside to try and keep iffy students that they want enrolled.

The reason for this pro tip is a few years ago I actually by chance I stumbled upon it when I applied for law school. I had 2 schools I was deciding between and I genuinely called one school to deny them because the other school offered more money. This leads to a back and forth between the two schools escalating bid. I went from a 5K scholarship to 22.5K.

Please do not be afraid to try and leverage admissions. They will not think less of you. No mark will go on your file. They are there to try and retain you!",LPT: scholarships are negotiable

LifeProTips,"(ETA - Estimated time of arrival)

(Posted on unpopular opinion but a couple people mentioned that it should be posted here)

When you're running 10 mins late to a social gathering, I think it would be better to say that you're gonna be 20 minutes late. Then, when you arrive 10 minutes late, your friends, date etc won't be as disappointed. However, worst case scenario, if you say you are going to be 10 minutes late and something happens that will hold you up further, you make your situation worse.

Too often when I'm meeting up with someone, they would underestimate their ETA in an attempt to make the group feel better but honestly I think it makes it worse.",LPT: It's usually better to overestimate your ETA
