LifeProTips,"This happened to me way back in 2003 - on a date with a rather nice guy. I was so nervous I swallowed funny and my food caught in my throat! I remember clearly my thought processes: ""can't swallow, can't cough, can't breathe, can't talk - I have 4 and a half minutes until brain death unless someone in this restaurant knows the Heimlich. There are about 40 people here, I bet the odds are pretty good...and you know, my date's a handy guy, bet he might be one of them!"" I stood up and started waving my hands around, forgot the ""international sign for choking"" (hands around the throat) but mimed the Heimlich and pointed at my mouth. My date figured it out, thankfully, did the Heimlich on me in front of 40 shocked onlookers, and saved my life! I found out 2 weeks later though that an acquaintance of mine had DIED in exactly the same circumstances because she had gone to the bathroom alone to try to clear her airway in private, and that this is a very common thing to happen.

LifeProTips,"Getting a microchip is an added measure of safety. Having worked in the pet industry for many years I have heard tons of excuses as to why people don’t want to microchip their pets. The number one reason is that they know their pet would never run away. Pets don’t have to “run away” to be lost. I knew of a gentleman who got in a car accident, his dog was in the car and took off into the woods. My aunts house caught on fire and their cat indoor escaped (luckily). Both animals were returned to their owners thanks to microchips. 

I will also say, from experience, that people love to “save” any animal they find, and sadly a good portion of the population is under the impression that if there is no microchip, the pet now belongs to them. A woman brought a dog into my work that was “homeless” and she was thrilled at how well mannered and healthy this “homeless” dog was. She was disgusted and completely non-receptive when I suggested that maybe he wasn’t homeless, he just didn’t have a chip and needed to find his family.

Since the beginning of the school year she has kept parents in the loop about things and sent many instructions home about virtual learning in the event that they go full virtual. Well, it happened.

LifeProTips,"Be polite, courteous and blunt when you want something from someone

It’s weird how often this is ignored. If you want someone to give you something/ do something for you, beating around the bush and talking casually or rudely isn’t going to get you anything. Negotiation is a subtle art which, used properly, can basically bend anyone to your will (not in a superhero way)

If you need a favour, don’t demand; request. Be blunt and to the point. No one appreciates having their time wasted. Remember that you aren’t entitled to anything from them. When making a request, start with a related recent accomplishment to appeal to them (1 sentence), then go straight to your request. Any excuse you have comes after this. This is incredibly useful in every setting, be it online or not. 

For example, say you have a work/school assignment whose deadline was today, but you failed to complete it in time and want to ask your boss/ teacher for extra time. If you’ve completed part of the assignment, tell them that, then go straight to the request. Don’t be afraid to stoop down and say “sorry, thank you and please”.

LifeProTips,"Basic idea: By using the ""Manage search engines"" (Chrome/Chromium), or ""One-click Search engines"" (Firefox), etc.\*  options you can use easy 2-letter keywords to search any website of your choosing!   e.g. In the search bar, if I type ""wk ducks"", it searches for ""ducks"" on wikepedia (and goes directly to the page, in this case), if I type ""gs ornithology"", it searches for ""ornithology"" on google scholar -- This is extra nice after using F6  (or Ctrl+t ) to get to the address bar. 

Chrome Instructions:

1) Search for something simple (e.g. ""Quack"") in a website of your choice.  Somewhere in the resulting url, should be the word ""Quack"", e.g. ""https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=***Quack***"" \*\*

2) Copy the URL, and go to ""Manage search engines"" in ""Settings"".  Click ""Add"", then give this engine a name, some (e.g. 2-letter) keyword, then paste the copied URL in the last field. Replace the word you searched with ""%s"", and you're done!

3) Now, right from your search bar, you can type \[whatever keyword\] \[space\] \[whatever query\] to search whatever you want on whatever website!

LifeProTips,"Whenever you are cooking a meat like poultry, beef, pork, lamb, ect, I highly recommend that you take some time in advance of cooking to generously salt the meat before cooking it.

If I am cooking a roast for example, I will salt it about 24 hours before cooking, and let it hang out in my fridge. For things like steak and pork chops, I'll typically salt them in the morning and throw them in a bag until I cook them later at night.

What will happen is that some of the water in the meat will get pulled out, dissolving the salt, then will be reabsorbed into the meat.

When you go to cook it, do not rinse the meat off, but do blot it dry with a paper towel. Do NOT add more salt. It should already be perfectly seasoned at this point throughout!

LifeProTips,"When I saw a therapist a few years ago for my problems, I had a hard time during our sessions because I would not be able to remember what I wanted to talk about. A combination of relying on my memory and talking about difficult subjects made it hard for me to get all of my thoughts and feelings out. That is why I feel like it was not that helpful for me - because even though I talked about and solved some problems, there were others I was unable to speak of and thus remained untreated.

When you are with your therapist, you feel like you are in a safe environment (assuming they are good people, of course). While that is good, it might also give you a harder time talking about your struggles because you are most likely not feeling them at that moment.

So one day, I tried something new: On my phone's notes app, I created a new page, titled it ""For Therapy"", formatted it as a bullet-point list, and whenever I would have negative feelings or struggled with my mental health, I would immediately write what I was feeling in the heat of the moment.

For example, I struggle with social anxiety, and one of the things that happens frequently is that I'll talk to someone, run out of topics to say, and start feeling anxious from the awkward silence. When that would happen, I would casually go on my phone and type ""Talking to friend. Running out of things to say. Feeling anxious."" It doesn't have to be paragraphs or anything - just a very brief description of what you are feeling at that moment. When I talk to my therapist, just seeing that brief description will trigger enough memories for me to talk about it in detail.

Doing this will be especially useful if you are seeing a Psychiatrist who might diagnosed with a mental disorder. Doing some self reflection lately, I have been considering the possibility that I may have ADHD, and sure enough, when I look at the long list of things I wrote over that the past few months, a lot of it lines up with what I researched about ADHD. I'm not diagnosed yet, so I don't know for sure if it even will be ADHD, but whats important is that I have the list so that whatever I do or don't get diagnosed with, it will be as accurate as possible.

**Try not to read over the list you make frequently.** While it is good to list your thoughts, reading over them frequently might end up putting you in a bad mood. Try to only read over them when it is necessary, like self-reflecting, or talking to your therapist.","LPT: If you are struggling with mental health, create a bullet-point list on your phone's notes app where you can IMMEDIATELY jot down any negative feelings/thoughts when they come up.

Obviously along with that you have to take care of your hygiene, grooming, invest in a good cologne and dress well or at least acceptable.

LifeProTips,[removed],Hello Everyone.
LifeProTips,"When people repeat things it's a pretty heavy indication that it's occupying their mind in some manner. I've found that almost every time it's productive to ask about it, regardless of what it is that they're bringing up. 

Is it a decision they made? Maybe it's weighing on them heavily or in unexpected ways and would like to talk it out.

An anecdote? Maybe there's a funny or personal story to go with it or one they haven't had the chance to tell anyone.

Complaint? You can learn a lot about a person through even the small things they find annoying. If you're lucky, you might be able to even work towards a resolution.

Is it a hobby, interest, or even a reference you didn't catch? People love talking about their interests, and if you're willing to listen you can learn a lot.

It obviously goes without saying that the usefulness of this technique fades the more a subject is discussed. If someone's complaining about the same thing over and over again you may not want to re-engage that conversation and create a negative feedback loop. On the whole, though, I find that people have a lot to offer for those that are willing to listen - but sometimes might be shy or feel awkward in a given moment about presenting themselves.","LPT: If someone mentions something in passing two or three times, even over the course of weeks or years, ask them about it."

LifeProTips,"My city (McKinney, TX) has two small libraries, and they leverage Cloud Library to power its e-book catalog.  The selections are sometimes meager due to this combination. And I think Cloud Library’s UX sucks. 

Luckily, the McKinney Library has a lending agreement with many neighbors (Frisco, Plano, Allen), which allow citizens of each city full or partial checkout privileges at their libraries. This means I can access four different libraries, and between them I almost always find the book I’m looking for. 

When a title is in more than 1 catalog yet checked out, you can put in distinct holds per library, thus maximizing the chances of getting a copy sooner vs. later.  

I like my privileges at Plano’s library, as their e-books are powered by Libby, which has a great UX.

Quite often you'll be given no reason as to why you were denied an interview or an offer of employment, so it's like throwing a dart at the wall blindfolded and hoping there was a target there to begin with. 

A lot of the above can be thwarted with knowing someone who knows someone, who knows someone else, to flag the application for review. You don't have to have a one-to-one relationship to get noticed, sometimes you can be referred by a friend of a friend, but that referral is application gold. The hard part is backing up the value of that referral. It's not an automatic ""shoe in the door,"" but it's much better than the spot I've been in for years trying to battle it out alone. Don't be me! 

Also, internships and/or contract work can be beneficial, but be sure to verify with the mentor/supervisor that the internship/contract has a ""potential for full employment"" or a ""letter of referral"" written into the job description. A lot of companies these days offer internships as a form of non-paid labor or underpaid temp work with no direct benefit to you and contract work is purposefully temp to benefit company production with minimal benefits to the contractor. Great for immediate cash flow, but means little towards a lifelong career if the company is abusive with it.",LPT: Seniors (High School/College) Remember to Network as much as you can!

LifeProTips,"With the holidays coming up I wanted to share this tip with you all. When you get money as a present, being for Christmas, your birthday, or other festivities, let the person who gifted you the money know what you bought with it.

I myself reserve the money I receive from these kind of event to buy vinyl records, but you could also buy a pet-toy with it, or even better, something that you and the other person share a common interest in. Buy something relating to shared hobbies for instance, or in my case, buy a vinyl record of an album you know you both enjoy.

Since a lot of people just gift money out of a lack of creativity, or just genuinely not knowing what you like, this is a great way of giving them the feeling that they actually gifted you a suiting gift. They'll feel better about giving you money and you buying something worthwhile for it, than if they would have gifted you money to put on your bank account.","LPT: When getting money as a gift, show the person what you bought from that money."

How to Figure Out What Type of Plane You’re Flying On [https://www.afar.com/magazine/how-to-figure-out-what-type-of-plane-youre-flying-in](https://www.afar.com/magazine/how-to-figure-out-what-type-of-plane-youre-flying-in)

* Almost every airline in the world lists the aircraft type on the reservations page of its website (typically displayed near the flight details).
* If it is still unclear, type in your origin, destination, and date of travel on the [ITA Matrix](http://matrix.itasoftware.com/), a flight search engine.
* NOTE: Airlines sometimes have schedule changes, especially for flights booked more than a few months in advance, which could change the flight timing or the aircraft.

[flightradar24.com](https://www.flightradar24.com/), [airfleets.net](https://airfleets.net), and [expertflyer.com](https://www.expertflyer.com/) are also good tools to help research the type of plane.

Edit: It is possible (although highly unlikely due to the expense) that an airline will change the plane (it happened to one commenter as they were about to board the plane). **Be sure to re-check the plane model before the flight and at the gate.** You are probably not be entitled to a refund of any kind if you switch flights because they switched the plane model, but for me, paying a fee to switch flights would be worth my peace of mind not to fly a 737 Max.","LPT: the FAA has cleared the 737 Max (the airplane grounded 20 months ago after two deadly crashes).

LifeProTips,"After working many years on a help desk and being the only one in my department willing to never let an issue go unresolved, I’ve started to realize very quickly when I’m dealing with someone not too knowledgeable or don’t want to take a long time to resolve the issue. 

Example: I’ve called Xfinity about 5 times over 1 1/2 years because I’m getting 1/3 of the speed I’m paying for and every time explained this keeps happing, something wrong we go through these steps everytime. FINALLY someone suggested that I call the router company and wouldn’t you know it was an issue with my router settings. 

Example 2: Today tried to pull money out of my 401k due to the no penalty if you’ve been effected by COVID and need money for expenses. Dude kept telling me I’ll get taxed AND 20% taken out, but if I do a rollover IRA I won’t. I kept mentioning that’s not what the IRS website says about the CARES distribution and knew he wasn’t right. So called again later and what do you know? I was right and if I did it the other way I would of gotten it taxed for all of it next year in taxes instead of splitting it in three years.

LifeProTips,"This applies for all things that you can “turn off” but in reality go into standby mode ready to be switched on again at a moments notice - for example, lamps that are switched off with a side cable instead of at the wall. Items on standby are often highlighted with a light (for example the red light in the corner of the TV). Modern appliances are often like this because we as humans are lazy and it’s far easier to push a remote control than it is to get up and turn something off at the wall. 

That being said, anything plugged in is still drawing electricity and turning it off at the wall can reduce your energy bill and consumption. Some estimates I’ve seen say you can save £80 a year in a single household by turning things off at the wall. In households, it accounts for 5.9% and as much as 10% of power bills. You'll help the environment too, with your household saving 1000 kg of carbon dioxide emissions each year.

I’ve also read that leaving chargers plugged in and on but not attached to anything can shorten their lifespans but I’m not 100% sure about the validity of that claim! In any case turning it off at the wall won’t hurt.

LifeProTips,"Your first two years in college, you will be taking the same classes as eveyone else. English/Lit, math, a science of some sort, humanities type class, etc. So if you don't get a decent scholarship, there is nothing wrong with taking those basics at your local community college. Most community colleges nowadays even offer a great selection of electives to allow you to venture into fields you may be interested in if you're not truly committed to your major (or have no idea what to declare as your major).

If you take these classes as seriously *as if *you were in a four year university,  you can actually get a transfer scholarship for having a decent GPA. And it is easier to do better in these classes because, in my experience, the class sizes are much smaller allowing for a better teacher-to-student ratio not found in any public universities.

Without this, the job would not be worth it depending solely on tips. Many drivers end up breaking even with the cost of gas and wear and tear on their vehicles. Delivery drivers are risking their safety to provide you a service and should be tipped even if it’s small amount.

Try and find it in yourself to dish out a few extra bucks to your delivery drivers especially during Covid right now.

      If it is surface deep you will see the blood disappear the instant you rub spit in with finger. 

      If the stain is deeper, like bled through jeans or other cloth: remove excess blood with paper, then spit, rub in, and wipe (careful not to spread blood with wiping too early). If possible, remove clothing items and carefully rinse blood spot area with minimal water to dilute. Spit, spit and spit some more on BOTH sides of clothing. Even if you can't remove without using water: a clear, wet spot is better than a stinky, blood spot 👍 if determined not to use water : you're going to need drink some periodically to make enough spit.

Extended pro tip: if bled thru, out and about and absolutely cannot use water because first date or work meeting: focus on blotting out both sides to remove excess, then focus mostly on spitting on outside and removing the visible part of stain. Blood on inside garment will dry enough with paper towels (this is often the case with jeans, which are so thick it is difficult to reach all fibers without water or so much spit and time your date will wonder where you are.

Best when used on fresh blood, but works on dried as well with water rinse. Great as a prewash before washing at home to ensure no discoloration.

If you still see blood after spitting and rub: you did not spit enough.

Try it out at home as a prewash next time. It's much easier to handle a little spot while out if you're not panicking and you've done it before.

LifeProTips,"Hello, I've noticed that a lot of people tend to punish their dogs or pets whenever they do something wrong, but don't praise them when they immediately correct their behavior (as a result of that punishment). I have a dog that loves to pick up sticks while we're walking, but he has a tendency to chew and swallow the pieces so I've made it a habit to yell at him whenever he does. Instead of just yelling, if he immediately releases the stick, I praise him for the proper reaction.

We're used to just punishing our pets if they do something wrong, but if they correct themselves as a result of your own reaction, you should praise them for it. Many people would see their dog/pet do something bad, punish, and when the pet corrects themselves, they leave it at that. It's important to praise that correction!","LPT: When your dog/pet does something wrong but immediately corrects themselves, don't just leave them hanging. Praise them!"

LifeProTips,"Any habit is composed of three basic components:

1.	Trigger: The event that prompts you to start the habit
2.	Task: The thing you do
3.	Reward: The reason you do the task

The trigger is out of your control, but you should try to identify it. What prompts you to start the habit? If you can identify that, you can brace yourself whenever that trigger occurs.

The task is the thing you want to change. I’ll come back to this later.

The reward is the whole reason you do the task. Habits are just shortcuts in our brain and the reward is why our brain hardwired that shortcut. I mentioned you *should* identify your triggers. You ***need to*** identify the reward. I promise you there is a reward there somewhere.

Once you figure out the reward you’re getting, the next step is trying to find a substitute task that will give you the same reward. The only way to change a behavior is to replace it with a substitute behavior. So identify another task that can give you that same reward.

Example: Every afternoon at work, I would head down to the cafeteria at work and buy a cookie and a cup of coffee. I wanted to change this habit into something cheaper and healthier.

The trigger and reward were both unclear.

For the trigger, I would usually head down around 2:30 or so. Maybe that’s the trigger or maybe it’s hunger since I usually eat lunch around 11:00.

For the reward, it could have been the calories from the cookie, the caffeine from the coffee or the excuse to leave my desk. To identify the reward, I did a couple experiments.

First I tried bringing in some GORP as a healthier alternative to the cookie and some tea and tried having them at my desk. But that wasn’t as good -  the reward clearly didn’t feel the same. Next I tried going for a walk to give myself an excuse to get away from my desk, but that wasn’t as good. Finally I realized the missing piece: when I would head down to the cafe, I would stop and talk to some friends of mine that sat a few desks down. So as a final experiment, I started inviting them on walks with me - and it worked! The reward felt the same and I didn’t miss the cookie or coffee. The trigger was time (since I wasn’t really hungry) and the reward was time away from my desk with friends, so we set up a standing “meeting” every day at 2:30 for a 15 minute walk.",LPT: How to Change a Habit

LifeProTips,"We had the cleaners at our house today, and for the second time in as many months, they managed to lock a room with nobody in it after they left. The first time it was a bedroom; this time, a bathroom.

Locking interior doors will almost always have a built in safety feature to unlock them from the other side. There will be a small hole, through which you can stick a paper clip, small Allen wrench, straightened wire clothes hanger, etc. in, and usually push straight back on the lock or possibly move it around and activate a release. Depending on the knob, it will either be in the absolute center, or on the side next to the knob itself.

Unfortunately, when we had some painting done a few years ago, the morons who did it reinstalled most of the door handles backwards so that the access holes and the locks were on opposite sides. As a result, when I attempted to unlock the doors the equally stupid cleaners had locked out, I was pushing against hard metal. The release I needed was 180 degrees away, and I didn’t realize that was the issue until today.

As an EMT, I had a trick up my sleeve to open both of them without damage, but it’s a major safety issue if the handle is incorrectly installed such that the safety release is eliminated. My mom had brain cancer, and there was one night before she passed (when she still wanted the independence to go to the bathroom by herself) where she fell on the floor of the bathroom three different times. Today, after discovering the door issues, I checked that bathroom and it was also backwards. Once my raw fury subsided, I felt kind of stupid for not having noticed it before. Obviously, if it comes down to it, the fire department or police will break the door open, but that can take anywhere from 5-20 minutes after you first call 911 (not to mention might injure someone if they’re directly behind the door, or traumatize a child). If your child locks themselves in, or a drunk roommate passes out, etc., you need to know how to get in.

So, check all of the locking doors in your house. Make sure they’re installed properly so that the access hole and lock button are aligned. Know how to unlock all of them, and keep an appropriate tool in close proximity to each door so you can open it quickly (on top of the door frame is a good place for an Allen wrench, paper clip, etc.).",LPT: Check all your locking interior doors are properly installed so the lock button is aligned with the unlock access hole on the other side - it could save precious time in an emergency

LifeProTips,"I work in Information Technology and it's a never ending battle with people forgetting their passwords. Most people struggle with passwords because using a complex password with numbers, letters, and special characters is difficult to remember. There are a couple of strategies you can use so you don't forgot your passwords anymore.

The first strategy is password managers. These are programs/apps that remember your passwords for you. Password managers have you create a master password for your vault of passwords. The master password is the only password you need to remember, because the master password unlocks your vault where the rest of your passwords are stored. This makes is easy to have complex passwords for every website you use, because you just need to remember a single complex password.

Password managers use encryption to store your passwords, which makes it so hackers cannot read your passwords unless they have your master password. I also highly recommend setting up multi-factor authentication for you password managers as well. Multi-factor authentication makes it so that even if you master password is stolen, a hacker would need your cell phone to unlock your password vault.

Here is an article that has pros and cons for popular password managers: https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-password-managers

If you don't like the idea of a password manager, then I have a second strategy for remembering your passwords. This strategy involves using a phrase to create a password.

1. Take a look at this phrase in quotes: ""My name is John Smith and I like dogs""
2. If you take the first letter from each word, you get mnijsaild
3. Now if you add some numbers and a special character on the end you get this: mnijsaild246!
4. Now make the first letter capitalized and you get Mnijsaild246!

Now you have a complex password that is 13 characters long and made up of random numbers, letters and special characters. The phrase is something that is easy is remember, and helps you know each letter and the order it needs to be in. The numbers are also a pattern, since you start at 2 and then use the next two even numbers.

Hopefully this information helps some people struggling with passwords. It's a necessary evil in life, but the two strategies I talked about should help you get a better handle on it.",LPT: How to never forget your passwords

If you are living in an apartment or a dorm or any other situation where you’re renting where you live get tenants insurance. It’s fairly cost effective at between $10-50 per month (or potentially free, keep on reading!) and covers you for all sorts of stuff.

LifeProTips,"I worked in cellphone sales for seven years and one of the most common and heartbreaking questions was whether or not we could retrieve voicemail that had been deleted because a loved one had passed away and they now wanted to preserve it. The answer by that point is most commonly “no”. 

If you have an android phone and are using carrier voicemail, don’t delete your voicemail with regularity. This will give you the ability to look through older stuff and record it later if the desire arises.

If you have an android phone and are using the phone’s built in voicemail then the voicemail is all directly stored on your phone and retrieval of deleted is possible but potentially more complicated than what the average phone user is prepared to handle. You can save voicemail through third party apps in the play store.

If you have an iPhone it’s very easy to save voicemail that you haven’t deleted (open up the transcription option and you’ll see a share icon that will allow you to send an audio file of the voicemail to a variety of places) and possible but more complicated to retrieve voicemail that you have deleted.

In all cases it’s easiest and less stress inducing to simply hold on to them. If there’s one that you like in particular save it now, especially if you use carrier voicemail, as a lot of them expire after 30-90 days.",LPT: Don’t Delete Your Voicemail From Loved Ones Right After You Listen to It

Even if you're feeling bullied or harassed by management in some way - as long as your physical safety isn't threatened then you should absolutely stick it out and use loop holes and take sick days or vacation days or actively avoid people you don't like and then leave ASAP once you get a new job.

If you are looking for a loan, then don't worry about having multiple hard pulls on your credit report. First, it doesn't have much impact anyway. Second, it's OK to have your score take a hit when you take out a loan - you shouldn't be taking out multiple loans in a short period anyway. And third, the whole purpose of a high credit score is showing you're a low risk to lenders, thus worth getting a low interest rate. Getting multiple loan quotes may cost your score a couple points (which costs you literally nothing), and in return you could save thousands or even tens of thousands over the life of your loan.","LPT: Your credit score helps you pay less on interest.

Anyway, one of them is Chris Voss. He was a hostage negotiator and had techniques to  try and get a bond with the criminals to calm them down. One of the biggest things I got from it was the title I have here. Take the last bit of someone's thoughts and turn it into a question.

Them - ""Oh, I had such a terrible day. I got in an argument with my boss.""

You - ""Argument with your boss?""

Them - ""Yeah! He said that I don't work hard enough and that I should stay later.""

You - ""Should stay later?""

Them they would go on for this a bit and then you could say something like ""It sounds like you don't like your work atmosphere,"" or something that feels matches up with their emotions.

I can't tell you how much more people open up and how more relaxed I am about talking. I don't wait for someone else to stop talking to talk and I realize how much happier it makes the person I'm talking to.

Nothing is 100% going to work, but you might be surprised  if you try this out. Just never say ""What I'm hearing is that you're upset,"" never use the word ""I"" when talking.

Turkey thaws at a rate of 3-4 lbs a day (edit: thaw in the fridge, bottom shelf, on a cookie sheet), so a 21 lb bird needs to start thawing now to be ready for Thanksgiving. Note- drips from the turkey can contaminate food below.

Other turkey tips:

Don't stuff a bird for best results. Stuffing stops the air in the cavity from cooking the bird and makes it so the outside must be overcooked to get the inside to a safe temperature.

A safer alternative to stuffing that still enhances its flavor: butterfly the turkey and cook it on a bed of stuffing. This will reduce cooking time, look at a few recipes to get a feel for how long it takes.

If you have to thaw a turkey quickly, keeping it in cold running water for a few hours will work. However, this method take more work, can add another unknown time element if done the day of, wastes water, and I don't think the end results are a good as a slow thaw.

Avoid recipes that cook at 350°F or higher for the duration. I cook my 18-22lb bird at 250°F for about 3 hours, then go up 400°F for about an hour. (Edit: apparently Alton Brown's method starts high, then goes low, so there are other ways)

Use a probe meat thermometer to tell if the turkey is done. White meat should be be 165°F (maximum, after resting, the bird will continue to cook, so pull it ~10°F earlier) and dark meat 180°F.. Apparently 170-175 for dark meat is recommended by Cook's Illustrated.

While there are minor differences between brands, almost all frozen turkeys are the same. I always get the cheaper store brands. The only real differences are between Kosher/organic/seasoned.

EDIT:

Covid sucks- we should be avoiding large gatherings, avoid them. This tip is intended for large families or those who want leftovers. Stay safe people.

Don't baste or open the door to peek- it's more important to maintain a constant temperature. With a higher temp near the end, the bird will brown very nicely.",LPT: Start thawing a large turkey today for Thanksgiving (USA)

LifeProTips,"I've used cheap grain alcohol, cheap high proof vodka, and actual isopropyl alcohol and I can't tell a difference between effectiveness, I also don't deal with especially big insects.


See the bug. Wait for it to land on a hard surface like a countertop or wall. Spray it once or twice. It'll die pretty quick, and then it's easy to wipe it all up.


This also works great in the warmer months with flies



Edit: a few things -


Insecticide sprays are great for big outdoor jobs like killing large infestations of hornets or WASPs. I hate using bug spray indoors because I don't like the fumes and I have pets. Alcohol isn't good for your pets, but the fumes are much less hazardous than insecticides and it's way easier to clean up.



I don't believe that killing insects is ideal, I do believe that:

1. Catch and release outside doesn't work because they'll make their way right back in

2. Actual aversions, anxieties, and phobias exist revolving around insects, you won't always have someone there to remove or kill the bug for you, and this is a pretty good solution.



You should only be using a couple of squirts, I don't think the smell is a problem, but if you do then a few drops of essential oil will make your bug murder minty fresh.


Unless you're spraying onto high-end fabrics, a tiny amount of alcohol won't harm clothes, linen, etc.

LifeProTips,"This is my go-to technique when brainstorming for ideas or trying to solve a pesky problem. And it’s so simple that the more impulsive people usually bash it without even trying it. But it works.

.

It has helped me come up with dozens of ideas for products, content, and with dozens of solutions to hard problems (when in the past I was stuck struggling for hours to come up with even 1 or 2 good ideas). It worked for me, and hopefully it can help you get a nice creativity boost.

.

**And it’s so simple and easy, it has just 3 steps:**

Step 1: Get a piece of paper;

Step 2: At the top, write down the brainstorming topic, or the problem you’re trying to solve, or whatever else you’re working on;

Step 3: Start writing down ideas/solutions until the page is full. The first 5 or 6 will usually be easy. And those are also the ones you’ll end up discarding. The best ideas come later, after you use up the ‘easy outs’ and force yourself to think outside the box and go deeper.

.

Crazy simple, right? Almost seems too simple to actually be effective.

.

But it is. I promise you, if you give it a shot and use this, your brain will give you so many new ideas and help you overcome your challenges.

.

**NOTE:** I personally like doing it on a piece of paper, not on the PC. There’s a different energy to it, and for some reason I have an urge to fill out all the white space with text and solutions.

Hope this helps you come up with your next million-dollar idea!

If you’re a bigger guy, and you going #2 has non-insignificant chance of clogging the toilet, then get into the habit of flushing when you’re 1/2 to 2/3rds of the way through. This reduced me reaching for the plunger from “once in a while” to “never”.

LifeProTips,"Title says it all.

I am a recruiter at my firm and I rarely have candidates ask ""why"" or a follow up for improvement on why they were not chosen. There is nothing wrong with asking the recruiters why you did not get said position and if there is anything they recommend at all for improvement. It can help lead to fixing whatever is wrong so you can fix it going forward and shows you want to improve which is just as important when hiring.

If you make it to a second, third, or fourth interview I would ask the above.

LifeProTips,"The act of blurring/blocking license plates in car photos started in the import mod scene where people did not want to show their license in case a thief decided he wanted to steal the costly modifications on the car (turbo, nos, stereo) by looking for the car with the right plate.  Or it just looked ""cool"" to blur out your license.  Or you wanted to remain anonymous and so you didn't want people in your town recognizing your plate and then your online identity.  Whatever the reason, it was a silly trend to begin with.  

But when you are trying to sell your car online, people need to know that you are not a scammer.  They want to be able to either look up the VIN number of the car you listed, or the license plate (which would give them the VIN number) to verify that the car is the right make and model, registered in the correct state, and also allows them to order a carfax history report to see if the car's ever been in an accident, how many owners it's had, etc.  By blurring out the license and not listing the VIN, you are indicating ""Scam alert!"" and will get less responses than you would have from people who are weary of getting scammed, especially those who planned on bringing cash to buy the car.","LPT: When advertising your car for sale, don't blur out the license plate or at least put the VIN number in the ad"
