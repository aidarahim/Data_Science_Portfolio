LifeProTips,"Everyone complains about having to give and get shitty gifts, especially around the holidays, and it's reasonable to say that gift-giving is an art that some people are just bad at.... especially if you're forced to decide on something a few days before Christmas to take to a gift exchange. If you find yourself at a loss for what to get your loved ones this holiday season, an easy shortcut is to take notes on things they mention/admire a few weeks or months before an important holiday comes up. Then, when it's time to actually buy the gifts, you can look at your list of ""mentions"" and decide between them instead of wracking your brain over new ideas.

I've been doing this for a couple years and have quickly become the ""good gift giver"" of my family and friends.

My trusting (but naive) brother went out on a limb and completely revamped how his entire department gets its work tickets and completes its jobs.  Basically it was a pretty manual process that had multiple, redundant steps. My brother simply eliminated the redundant steps and moved it to the cloud from dedicated workstations.  He said it reduced the amount of time needed to perform each job by about 75%.

He's worked at the same company for about 18 years now, so you might be wondering wow he was rewarded.  Well, his entire department of 12 (and himself) were eliminated yesterday.

LifeProTips,"When someone expresses a fear, insecurity, or worry many people think it is helpful to immediately respond by telling them why they shouldn’t feel that way - and that makes sense, but it doesn’t help. If I have a deep-rooted insecurity that has built up over years, (let’s say it’s about something silly like my eye brows) telling me my eyebrows look fine isn’t going to undo years of convincing myself I have stupid looking eyebrows. What’s more is if I was vulnerable enough to tell you about my insecurity and you tell me I shouldn’t feel that way you’ve dismissed my feelings and I feel betrayed after trusting you with this information. 

Instead either stay silent and let the person talk or acknowledge their struggle and ask questions like: when did this first start? How can I help you? Do you want to know what I think about your eyebrows? This puts them in control of your response and will make them feel safe. You may eventually be able to say “for what it’s worth I think your eyebrows look good.” But only after validating their feelings and letting them express themselves completely.","LPT: When someone tells you about a negative feeling they have don’t tell them why they shouldn’t feel that way, instead validate their feelings and ask them questions to help them think through it."

I am posting this because I am seeing too many videos that disturb me with how people are taking them in their vehicles.

1. Make sure the recording device, be it phone, GoPro, or other device is in a stable and secure position or held by another person. I have seen too many videos where the person behind the wheel is driving and only has one hand on the wheel. Also, they are constantly looking to the camera and back to the road, this is distracted driving and it does kill people.
2. Make sure that you have your seatbelt on. I watch a youtube channel about a family who built their own home. They were driving to church and the father who was driving did not have his seat belt on. The wife was in the front passenger and holding the3 camera but the driver was constantly lo0okinmg from the camera to the road. The road they were on was narrow and winding and I feared they would either go off the road or get in an accident.
3. Fame and entertaining others are not worth your life. In this pandemic time, hospitals are stretched with their resources and abilities. Staying safe saves other lives in these times and prevents the use of materials that are in high demand and difficult to obtain by caregivers.

LifeProTips,"Hi,

i want to buy a house in a neighborhood where my wife grew up. the houses were all built around 40 years ago and many of the people living there are getting older. The area is very popular as the houses have direct access to small canals from the gardens, so in many cases, the kids of the people who originally bought the houses move in with their families.

My wife and I have thought about writing a letter and leaving it in people's mailboxes to let people know that we're in the market for one of the houses in the neighborhood.

I'm debating on how to approach this in the best way.

My idea was:

* make the point that we're a young family and that my wife grew up in the neighborhood (her mom still has a house there and she might be known which might be a bonus)
* say that we're looking for *a* house in the area and ask if someone knows of someone who'd sell their house instead of bluntly asking people to sell their home to us.

There are a few residents we know personally who might not be able to maintain a whole house anymore soon as they are very old but it is difficult to bring up the subject without antagonising them, I fear. I'd be very interested in your ideas to set this up!

LifeProTips,"I’ve found this is incredibly effective. Find ways of framing things through that person’s strengths. It is incredibly difficult to disagree with someone who is complementing you.

Soon, the person will realize that there is a different perspective on the subject.

For example, say you are married to someone who is leaving their socks on the floor.

“Hey [SO]! I wanted to ask if you can help me with something. I’ve been trying to find a way that we can keep our room clean, and I’m just bad at coming up with systems. You’re a great system strategist... do you think you can help me figure out how to keep stuff off of the floor?”

Or

“Hey [SO]! I am so glad we have this awesome place to live together. You’re so good at keeping things clean - I know you probably want to keep our room just as clean as the kitchen. What can we do to make sure we’re both keeping our clothes off the floor? I have never been as good at keeping the house clean as you so I need your help.”

A few guidelines here - don’t bullshit. Be honest. Use traits that the person is actually good at, not blowing smoke. They will detect it if they think you are just lying to get your way.

Also, make sure you aren’t self deprecating. You can say “I’m not as good as you are at this” without saying “I suck at this.”

If you don't know what's the next step life, college isn't neccessarily the best one. People that make it through college successfully are usually driven by a passion they found. They go to college because they actually want to learn their subject. College is a LOT of work compared to high school, and if you don't have something that keeps you going, you might end up dropping out like a lot of people. Not only do you need to have a passion for going to college, you might also want to have some research about your passion. The internet exists for a reason folks. First of all, look up if your dream job requires a college degree. Most higher level jobs require you to have a degree such as programmers, game designers, doctors, lawyers, scientists, teachers, etc. If your passion doesn't require college, then don't go there unless you have another good reason to. The last thing you want to do is go to college just becuase you don't know the next step in life. If your dream job does require one, then by all means, go to college. It won't garuntee you the job, but unless you have some special talent or are highly skilled in that job, without a degree you won't have a chance at it. College can also be used as a learning experience if you know nothing about that job. One of the first steps to being an adult is managing your money.

LifeProTips,"I'm not going to give you a 'call you're parents before xmas and they appreciate it and you will feel swell' advice like the other 99% of this subreddit does.

In any field, whether it's sales, jiu jitsu, collecting phone numbers etc. you have to expect to fail 99% of the times.

I learned this in telemarketing. the guys who were making the top sales had in their BEST days a 10% closing rate (this is about getting 100 calls a day and those getting after ringing 500-700 numbers A DAY). But on average, 80% of your cold leads will not be interested, 10% will tell you to piss off, 5% want to be called back (and will probably still say no) so you only have FIVE people left to close the deal and if you're LUCKY, you can close 2 instead of 1.

But this is the reality in ANYTHING. Whether it's drilling your armbars in jiu jitsu, you have to do it hundreds of times to get the movement. And even worse/better, you have to compete in 100 matches to be even considered GOOD in jiu jitsu because frankly, being in the top 5% is EASY. Getting in the 0.5% is FREAKING DIFFICULT.

Or think about music where people are busy HOURS AND HOURS to get a single note perfect. All good, but after you got your perfect kick, you have to find your snare, claps, hi-hats and getting advanced you have to play with the reverb/freeze and arpeggiator. You do know that you have to make hunderds of song to get the hit right? So shouldn't your focus be elsewhere?

Or getting girls. I can't stand the hate towards females by some guys who got rejected once or twice and think that is their life. It took me 1000 women to approach before I found my wife. It might be a short-cut when you get introduced by a friend, but from a cold call/approach standpoint, I haven't even done poop.

LifeProTips,"If you stay at a company for a long time, you'll have potential to move up the ranks in terms of title (assuming you are doing a good job), but you likely started at a pay rate applicable to the job you stared in. Your pay increases as you get promoted, but it will be smaller compared if you get hired on at a new company with a similar title. You get a lot of experience navigating your company, but you'll be limited because you don't get exposed to other various cultures, challenges, problems, technology, processes, etc.

Having experience at different companies makes you more marketable because you've been exposed to a lot of different challenges giving you much more experience than just coasting at the same place where things probably don't change a whole lot.

Be careful not to job-hop too much though (less than 2-3 years) or you may turn off employers because you'll give the impression you can't be trusted to add much value because your hiring manager/recruiter won't like the idea of expecting to have to train up a new person frequently.

Always look for opportunities outside your current company and you'll likely get bigger raises. If you're chasing a company retirement plan/pension, then that may be a factor and this may not apply. Otherwise, look around at different places and you'll likely find pay will go up much more. Obviously, there are some careers where this may not apply, but for the most part, this holds true (especially in corporate America). You also have to factor in stress level, benefits, and work hours in all of this too. Moving from a cushy job to a super stressful job, may not be worth the extra pay. Money isn't always everything. Try not to feel loyal to a company unless they really deserve it and they pay/value what you're worth and make you happy.

If your kid is having a hard time getting grades that are up to your standards already then do not purchase them an expensive gaming computer that they probably really, really want for Christmas this year. And the same goes for a PS5 or other devices. 

I work as a cultural liaison at a school with about 1,000 students, I have my own kids, and I work with hundreds of other educators and it's really hard right now for everyone, including the parents who often seem to be left out of these conversations. I'm seeing more and more kids that just aren't mature enough to manage the temptation to game all day and balance it with their other responsibilities. This is causing a lot of problems for them. I have kids who may not graduate on time or at all because of this problem. I'm not saying it's the only problem or even the biggest problem, but it is affecting many of my students and being a Grinch with an expensive gaming system now might be a loving thing to do even if they are dissapointed.  The $200 utilitarian chromebook that your school (probably) provided is enough for them. If you really want to give them an awesome gaming system then put it away every day until they do their schoolwork and let them have it on evenings and weekends if they demonstrate adequate progress. And don't just take their word for it, verify it with the school using the parent portal that comes with your online learning software.

I have heard many individuals refer to themselves using numerous terms similar to the ones above and while it may seem an apt description for the situation, it no doubt becomes self fulfilling when you hear “well, I *am* an addict, I’m just a junkie.” 

People with problematic substance use are still people and the concept of “sober” implies “free from substances” which isn’t always the case either. Methadone and Buprenorphine are both controlled substances used to aid in the recovery process, they are still drugs. They both show up on toxicology screening tests.

TL;DR words are powerful, using the correct terminology or even safe words around those with substance use issues or in recovery is essential in order to reduce shame, stigma and start a culture in which we accept, understand and can do more for those in need.

I've been thinking a lot lately about spreading my wings. There is obviously a lot of pros and cons when it comes to such a ""life changing"" decision right? I was hoping to be able to share my situation and look for advice from people who have already succeeded!

Few little things about me first:

* I'm a 21 year old male.
* Irish
* No higher level education.
* Currently living on my aunts kitchen floor.
* Extreme minimalist.
* Working 30 hours a week in supermarket.
* No real tied-down responsibilities.

I've been living in a kitchen for almost 2 years now. I really want to learn, do some soul searching, truly find what I want to do with my life, find purpose and of course establish a career path. In order for me to do this, I need my own damn SPACE!

I've got no space to breathe, no room to focus and no area to learn. I've got no real responsibilities, no family and no friends so relocating in terms of international levels is not a concern for me, in fact, because of Irish culture i'm more obliged to move abroad.

I don't know how realistic it is for a 21 year old guy to move far away, find a place, find a job, start learning some skills and develop themselves along the way. I don't know if its possible, however, i'm down to give it a go!

The plan I have in my head right now, is to work in my store building up some more cash for the next 3 months or so, at least until this vaccine rolls out! From there i'd like to find a studio apartment somewhere in Europe, find a job to pay the bills and start learning some essential skills like IT, Business and working on some digital art, like i've always wanted to do!

This is where I need your help.

I know, each person needs to pave their own path and what not, but how can you pave a path if you don't know which direction it's supposed to be going? The goal is to get a few different perspectives on how you guys started and how you successfully moved out!

and so my questions to you guys, are..

1. what are some countries that would be of benefit to a 21 year old?
2. how much money is a comfortable amount to leave with?
3. how do you overcome the fear of unknown?
4. what was your starting point?
5. should I get educated first?
6. is this even possible?
7. am I crazy?

Literally ANY information relating to these question is not only going to help me, but also tonnes of new people browsing for their answers too. Thanks for your time!",LPT: Moving out! Living on a kitchen floor..

Disposable pans. Not just for baking, you can mix in these, boil in these, store in these, \*anything\*.

You can get multiple sizes and shapes with many coming with their own storage tops. Walmart is particularly good about selling in sets of 2 or 3 with the tops included and dollar stores are another great place if you just need a couple.

Prepare, cook, and keep all in the same container.

Baked goods? Whisk up your dry goods in the pan and pour in the wet; unless you need to cream or otherwise mix the latter you're good to go! Bake in the whole thing.

Boiling? It'll take a bit longer but damn right you can do it.

Frying? I don't know, I wouldn't deep fat fry in one of these, but sauteeing? Yeah, you're good to go.

Will any of this be perfect or as good as in a pan? No. Absolutely not. You're getting the benefit of peace of mind, not culinary glory. Depending on the food it might look a little wonky but it's the taste that matters.

Does it feel silly? Darn right it does but when you're sitting there with a four-course meal and nothing to clean you'll feel like a king.

Don't let quarantine stop you from having a lovely meal. Prepare and freeze some things now, use disposable goods, and have a relaxing Christmas or holiday to yourself without losing the spirit of the day.

LifeProTips,"wrapping paper creates a lot of unnecessary waste and is only used once and thrown out the second the gift is opened.

For me, it was why I avoided The Godfather for years.

It is hyped to such an extreme that I felt that I would feel stupid if I didn't enjoy it.

It took a family member slowly introducing the movie to me for me to appreciate it.

Is it one of my favorite movies?

No.

Is it an interesting movie? Hell yeah.

It's one that I can go back and watch and find new things. I truly appreciate the artistry of that movie.

Hype can kill a film. It can build a movie up to such impossible heights that when a cynic finally sits down to watch the damn thing, there can be a feeling of ""that's it?""

Frozen is a good movie imo. 

The hype for that film is too much for its own good, since it's a Disney product. As a product, it was put in everyone's faces to such a degree that it is easy to forget that it's actually a pretty decent movie.

Same with a lot of Marvel movies.

I consider Black Panther one of my favorite films, but it's not perfect. It's hype was also too much for its own good.

Into The Spider-Verse is another one of my favorite movies, but its hype is sadly too much for its own good as well. I can see a cynical person watching it and being like, ""All that noise for a hyperactive cartoon?""

I think the movie is great, but the hype can easily cause someone to expect complete perfection.

I don't think extreme hype is a great thing for a moviegoing experience, unless you're already invested in a particular franchise.

If you're an outsider though, it can be bewildering.

So if you are that outsider and you wanna experience that hot thing that it seems like everyone can't shut up about----

Just go in with tempered expectations.

Don't expect it to change your life. 

Do try to go in with an open mind. 

You may not discover a 'masterpiece,' but you may end up actually having a good time.

Or you may hate it.

**The average staff nurse is paid about $61,000 a year, and an emergency medical technician earns just about minimum wage, for a yearly income of $27,000,** according to the Compdata analysis. Many medics work two or three jobs to make ends meet.

LifeProTips,"In the past using basic dictionaries, I tend to find the definitions to be either very plain or confusing in the sense that they would use terms or words that are too complicated to grasp the meaning of the word you are looking up.

&amp;#x200B;

Example for the word **Anomaly** in a basic dictionary I found:

&amp;#x200B;

**"" A deviation from the common rule, type, arrangement, or form. ""**

&amp;#x200B;

For me this is very confusing as it seems to be a very plain definition to me and doesn't really give an example for the definition. Someone might also not know what deviation means. They then would look up what deviation means.

&amp;#x200B;

**Deviation:**

**"" the act of deviating.""**

Well that is not a big help, as it's a very plain description and how would someone know what deviation means when they don't know what deviating means?

&amp;#x200B;

With the Cambridge dictionary the term for the word **Anomaly** is defined as as:

**"" A person or thing that is different from what is usual, or not in agreement with something else and therefore not satisfactory"".**

&amp;#x200B;

For me this is a much better definition as it explains the meaning of the word in a simple manner along with providing a good example. These are also simple words that nearly anyone can grasp and understand, compared to the previous definition where deviation was included.

&amp;#x200B;

**Deviation** in the Cambridge dictionary is also defined as:

**""The action of doing something that is different from the usual or common way of behaving""**

&amp;#x200B;

Well, this is much easier to learn the meaning the word instead of just ""the act of deviating"".

Yes, this does depend on the person mind you, but for someone like me who really struggles with reading and vocabulary coming from a science/technical background, this is such a big help.

Instead of clicking the button to go to the sale, which is exactly where they want me to go, I click up top to filter to men's vests and jackets, which is what I came to the site for.

LifeProTips,"Gratifying someone for being there for you and being understanding instead of insulting yourself for messing up is a great way to maintain self-confidence and to let the other person know that they’re greatly appreciated. It’ll be a win-win in the end!

I needed to really remember this a few years ago when I was going through a really bad depression a few years ago from a host of personal issues. I would talk to my friend a lot about the things that I had going on, and she was always there to listen. We were both always there for each other to listen if we needed to talk to someone, but at this time, it felt like it was me venting to her way more than the other way around. I started to feel like a burden to her, and I always would apologize, saying things like “sorry for complaining to you all the time”. She reminded me that instead of apologizing, I should say “thank you for listening”. She said that I should never feel bad for needing someone to talk to, and that if I shift the blame on me to gratification for the other person, it would make it harder for me to insult myself in the process. 

My self-confidence couldn’t have been lower at the time, so practicing saying “thank you” instead of being unforgiving to myself helped me to learn that I’m allowed to need help and I’m allowed to make mistakes without being a bad person.

These days, along with other changes that I’ve made in my life, my self-confidence is at the highest that it’s ever been. Making others feel good for being a big help feels way better making yourself feel bad for being imperfect.

Here’s some examples of what I’ve started saying instead:

“Sorry for being late.” = “Thanks for waiting for me!”

“Sorry for talking so much.” = “Thanks for always being there to listen!”

“Sorry, I so stupid for doing that.” = “Thank you for being so patient with me!

LifeProTips,"Just a little LPT for those who may not have thought about it but there are A LOT of plants that can kill/hurt our pets. Dogs especially because some dogs want to try EVERYTHING that smells remotely delicious. And some dogs don't care if they get sick.

My parents have a huge yard that use to have several large China Berry trees that over the years we removed until one was left for the dogs to have shade. We never had a problem until we got one of our dogs, Sancho. He would start acting funny and wobble around and one night about 2 years ago he overdosed on these berries, he stopped breathing and everything. 

We thought we lost him but then just as suddenly as he stopped breathing a minute or two later he sprang back up confused af. Turns out the berries are hallucinogenic drugs dogs love but are poisonous and can kill them. 

Turns out Sancho loves doing drugs and gets high often, even after the last major overdose.  We finally got the tree removed this year after our new puppy, who loves to eat everything too, got high. My step-dad was an ass and just didn't want to do the labor for removing the tree other wise it would have been out years ago. 

Moral of the story is you may not realize something is dangerous to your pets and it may be their favorite thing to eat. Moving somewhere new or notice strange behavior in your pets? Figure out the plants in your yard or even what you have inside and check if they can make your pet sick. 

Also essential oils can be dangerous for pets! This is a big one too especially because people love using diffusers

I'm 14 right now and I had this problem starting on my birthday. I listened to a song, a bad apple. and it made me think for a bit. then a thought, and thought a bit more. eventually, it spiraled, furtherer, and furtherer into a pit of neverending despair. I did do a lot of research over it, and I've come to a point, I would say I'm near the ""end"" point, I'm not really suicidal, on the contrary, I fear death, however, I've also realized many things about it. Death means my memories will all but vanish, and that I'll restart everything anew, that comforted me at first. but then thought about it, it really started to terrify me. life is ultimately meaningless, but so is death. Even the meaning we give to it is a bit meaningless really. all we can do is just keep going. i often find myself just sitting there wondering why things are the way they are. Honestly speaking, I have no idea how anything works, How I'm here, at this very moment. I ended up having a panic attack after the first time but at this point I've realized. Life is smiliar to a switch. We can flick the switch and the light will turn on, We don't need to find the logistics of it, so I can find some comfort in that fact. Still, I envy the ignorant, as they can just go on never thinking about this. Much like a trapped animal or someone in a simulation, if they don't know they're trapped, they'll just go on as normal. My existential depression, in the end, has made me realize the universe's absurdity, and maybe a simple but terrifying truth, everything is ultimately meaningless. we're just apart of a machine in a way, we just are. we live, we die, we live again, in an endless, neverending cycle.

Time is the most valuable resource we have so it helps to be increidbly conscious of how we are spending our time. Are our commitments bringing us joy? Are they causing additional mental stress and anxiety? Are we developing a new skill?

While it can get quite complicated to decide if we should continue our packed commitment schedule or reduce a few commitments, I have found this rule to be quite helpful as a quick litmus test. I read about it last year in a book but this was the first year I felt quite overwhelmed in my professional life and this was incredibly helpful in assessing my commitments outside my day job. It has lead to a couple of conversations where I withdrew from a couple of commitments and feel a whole lot better about my self and am able to give my 100% to everything else I am doing.

I don’t think any satisfied customer will actively say “no, I don’t want you to get a promotion, so I won’t give good feedback.” THE PROBLEM IS that most of us don’t think about leaving feedback, unless we’re angry.

White / Men are more privileged than Black / Women, it's okay to admit it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


White / male privilege exists because of historic, cultural enduring racism, sexism and biases. You did not cause history to develop a culture that has left a legacy that continues to make life smoother and more streamlined for white men.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
Don’t Panic:

a. We do not need to apologize for our privilege.

b. We do not need to feel defensive of being “white” or “male”

c. We do not need to go about life feeling shamed for the colour of our skin or the shape of our genitals. Neither should anyone else.

d. Being privileged does not mean you have not suffered or struggled.

e. Yes, some white men do not benefit from the privilege of our skin and sex as much as others.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
What is White Male privilege?

a. a built in advantage separate from one’s “work ethic” – think a race where you start further ahead than the Black Women and there are less obstructions and obstacles along the way.

b. having less pesky obstacles in life, less sideways glances, less negative assumptions, more access to power and resources, more ease moving through the world (professional, corporate, legal).

c. something that is unconsciously enjoyed and consciously perpetuated.

d. something we have inherited from a history and legacy of slavery, colonialism and domestication of women. We didn't create it, but we do benefit from it.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
What to do about it?

a. Don’t panic, just be cool, its not a big deal to admit you are privileged, you are still loved and can still be an awesome cool person who makes big waves in life.

b. Be deeply curious of the lived experiences of those who are less privileged. Ask questions, learn learn learn. You will become more wise and powerful for it.

c. Reflect regularly on how the distribution of privilege affects the distribution of wealth and access to opportunities for a good life. Privilege has real world implications - many of which we white men do not notice because we don't see the obstacles other's face.

d. Expand your sense of self. You do not have to defend “whiteness” or being a “man”. You are as much a unique butterfly as the ""Black Woman"" and you both deserve a life beyond these basic lazy boxes that constrain us and bind us.

e. Consider how you can help challenge the traditional powers structures that give you this privilege. A more equal society will be a good thing for everyone, including us white men.

LifeProTips,"Your immune system has several jobs and works in several ways.  Taking care of unfamiliar objects in your mouth is one job of your immune system, so brushing your teeth frees up resources to fight bugs elsewhere.

Your mouth is frequently one of the major battlefields of a germ war, and toothpaste will kill some of the germs.

One of the ways your body disposes of germs is ejection (e.g. coughing, sneezing), brushing will make sure those germs don't reenter your body.

You will tend to drink water after brushing, and hydration is important when sick.  I often have trouble drinking water when I'm sick because of ""mouth crud,"" but can drink after brushing.

Finally, it reduces the germs in your mouth, making you less likely to spread your cold to others.

Before allowing anyone to treat you, you ought to ask these three questions:

-Did you actually take a class in this disorder?

-Have you done any research with this disorder?

-Were you ever supervised by a professional who has done the first two things while working with clients?

Importantly we can never have to convince them. When the Tooth Fairy is late, I just say ""huh, that's odd. Why do you think?"" Or ""maybe we should make sure the tooth is in the middle of the pillow.""

My daughter even asked if the Tooth Fairy might give toys instead of cash. Of course I had no idea so she left a note. The Tooth Fairy replied back ""no, this is a teeth for cash deal."" It was a bit suprising. Another note asked to see her. It got the obvious 'no' but also left behind a hastily drawn self portrait.
