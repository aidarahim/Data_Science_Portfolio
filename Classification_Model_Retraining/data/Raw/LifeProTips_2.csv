LifeProTips,"Lots of people call an ambulance for BS, but when it’s serious we spend a large amount of time looking at medication bottles and looking for ID.
Most important thing is medical history, PERTINANT medical history. This means: How many heart attacks and when, strokes and when, Diabetes?, COPD?, Asthma? have they ever been intubated? Stents? Dementia? Cancer? CHF? CRF? Hypertension? DNR or MOLST? We dont care about knee replacements or tonsilitis 10 years ago.
Next is blood thinners. They take 81mg of aspirin? Coumadin? Plavix? If your loved one has fallen and they take blood thinners they probably have a brain bleed. Also means their doctor knows they are at risk for a heart attack.
Next is Name, Date of birth, and social security number. This will allow the hospital to pull up all their records so ultimately it is most important. With the internet, all hospitals share records so it doesnt matter if she normally goes to x hospital because y hospital has a trauma team for that brain bleed.
That’s really it. Everything else can go on the next page. Make copies that we can take, put a blue star of life on it, put it near the orange medication bottles (we are looking there anyway). On the front door, by the bed and toilet (often where the patient is), maybe the fridge?
Feel free to add other medications, allergies, emergency contacts (dont count on us calling you, we’re busy with your mom), and today’s date so we know if this info is 5 years old or not. On the later pages you can put their GP’s info, more indepth history, maybe their hip replacement, but no one needs to see that until the patient is stable in the hospital. I will put your loved one in a bed and put the packet at their feet for every nurse or doctor to see.

LifeProTips,"This seems to be a little known feature that I'm surprised not more people are using.

If you have a recent Android phone (Android 9 or later) then you can go to Settings -&gt; Wifi and Internet -&gt; Private DNS. Here you can select 'Private DNS provider hostname'. There are many providers you can select here, but a certain subset of those will refuse to resolve ads, tracking and other malicious content, telling your device the ad/tracker doesn't exist and effectively blocking it's content from being displayed. This will also save you some mobile data, as those ads are not downloaded.

Below is a selection of choices, but feel free to go out and look for others if you don't like or trust these.

Enter into the Private DNS field bolded part of one of below services:

* **ads-dot.securedns.eu** - claims to keep no logs
* **dns.adguard.com**
* blahdns.com - check the website and select your nearest server

This should block most ads you see as long as they're not native ads (served by the app itself without using third party app service or from the website's own domain), they're not YouTube ads or the ads are not cached (wait for the cache to expire or clear data from individual apps, if you can).

You can also set these DNS servers on your home network's router, effectively blocking ads for any device that connects to it. This can be bypassed by devices that have their own DNS servers hardcoded and do not use router's DNS server (such as a Chromecast), but this is not very common.

**Things to consider**

* Chrome on Android does not respect your device's DNS settings. You can disable this behaviour by opening a new tab, in address bar entering chrome://flags, finding 'Async DNS Resolver' and disabling it.
* If you want to disable adblocking per device, just set custom DNS servers on that particular device.
* If you do not have access to home router (certain ISPs) or your router won't allow you to change your DNS servers, look into /r/pihole/.","LPT: You can change your DNS setting to block ads, trackers and malicious websites on your Android phone or every device on your home network."

I was recently at work and saw thousands of little black birds flying in swarms near the trees by my office. I even called my coworkers to come over to check it out. Soon after the birds all flew away.

Not even 15 minutes later I got a phone alert about a dangerous ""Snow Squall"" coming to my location. About 10 minutes after that I saw that appeared to be a white wall coming over the lake towards my office. It was an insane snowstorm that created whiteout conditions that would make driving extremely dangerous. I couldn't even see the end of my office buildings parking lot.

LifeProTips,"I put this up in /r/unethicallifehacks because I guess it could be considered stealing, but then there's also numerous posts here of how to get around paywalls. I figured this all out yesterday on my own and figured I'd share for anyone in the same boat.

I was wanting to design a logo for personal use, and there are some very good ""Free"" websites that allow you to do so. However, all the ones I came across would want a pretty substantial fee to download and further edit your creation without their watermark.  I attempted a few ""tricks"" of my own and it came out perfect for what I wanted.

**Step 1:** Create your logo - https://i.imgur.com/vf2KzrX.png  (Here you can see the logo designer for this site, and their watermark)

**Step 2:** Use the Windows (or similar) Snipping Tool to capture your logo &amp; background as I did for the screenshot above

**Step 3:** ***This is the big one***, and I learned it from Gran Turismo Sport on PS4 for uploading custom decals: **Vectors**. Vectors allow you to scale the image as large as you want while barely losing resolution, if any at all.

Head to a site like [Vectorizer.io](https://www.vectorizer.io) and upload your Screenshot.  From here, you can select what colors you want to be included, and this works great since logo's typically have only a few colors, and this is where it will be easy to filter out the sites Watermark if it even shows. Example: https://i.imgur.com/1L0dVMG.png - Getting the settings down right may take some trial and error, but it should be completely doable. Sometimes the result looks better than you expect after ""Vectorizing"". **Download the .SVG File.**

**Step 4:** Use GIMP or another editing program to open the .SVG - Notice how you can decide Width &amp; Height and Resolution ? https://i.imgur.com/vzyDVGI.png  - You can set it to basically whatever you want and the resolution will be perfect. (Use at least 600dpi) This works out GREAT when printing. **(I printed out something I stretched to 6500x9200 and it looks perfect....thats nearly 11"" wide on paper)**

Step 5: Make any edits/changes if you like: https://i.imgur.com/v4Fcjmm.png  (Might not be PERFECT, but I made this in like 2 minutes as an example)

It should be something you haven’t seen or haven’t watched in a long time. This way, if you want to know what happens next, you’ll have motivation for working out.

Because it’s long form, it will encourage you to pace yourself and do more low energy cool downs between high energy stuff. Definitely helps with endurance.

Something formulaic like Phinias and Ferb or Code Lyoko might be good. (Do cool downs at “I know what we’re going to do today! Or 20 situps at “where’s Perry?”)

If you’re a film student, or interested in film, maybe do 30 jumping jacks every time the the camera does a particular thing. Like, Better Call Saul uses a lot of blues and yellows, every time you see the two together do a high knee jog. Or every time Saul uses his grifter voice switch to walking in place and drinking water.

You can also just convert regular drinking game rules into it, but instead of alcohol, do exercise. Pin the rules on the wall and make a game of if.

Keep time in mind too. An 11 minute cartoon or a youtube show like Rhet and Link’s ‘Will It’ might be a better start than breaking bad or doctor who.

Keep in mind emotions as well. If you know something will make you cry maybe steer clear unless you’re cool with sobbing while doing burpees. Stick with comedy, action adventure, and drama.

LifeProTips,"Most baking recipes that your search for online (especially tailored at Americans) have just way too much sugar. You can make a crappy recipe taste ""sweet"" which some people correlate to ""good"". But most recipes I think actually taste better when they're not overloaded with sugar.

2 examples recently:

* 1) Friend made a cheesecake, tasted too sweet, used this recipe. I made adjustments and liked it better with less sugar. The original cheesecake wasn't bad, just too sweet, making it harder to taste the essence of the cheesecake and making it taste like overpowering sugar cheesecake.  
 [https://sugarspunrun.com/best-cheesecake-recipe/](https://sugarspunrun.com/best-cheesecake-recipe/)   
My adjustments: 
   * Don't add any sugar/brown sugar into the crust! Having some contrast between the crust and a sweeter cheesecake is good.
   * 1 cup of sugar for a cheesecake is too much, try 1/2 to 2/3 cup.
* 2) I was looking for different cornbread recipes and decided on this one:  [https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/230683/sour-cream-cornbread/](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/230683/sour-cream-cornbread/)   
My adjustments:
   * Instead of using 1 1/3 cup sugar, used somewhere between 1/2 to 2/3 cup. I thought this made for some very good cornbread. If people want it sweeter, you can always top it with some honey.

LifeProTips,"I find that having my email clean makes it easier to search or pull an email quicker than when it’s full of junk and promotions. It might not be for you, but if you’ve ever wanted to clean your email, one of the easiest ways is to start unsubscribing from mailing lists! It’s also a really good mindless task if you need a break from other things. 

For most chain emails, it takes about 2 seconds to find the ‘unsubscribe’ button on the bottom of the email. For the rest, it takes about 10 seconds max. If you take 10 minutes each day to do this, you’ll eventually receive less emails daily. Then the 10 minutes can be used to delete past emails that have accumulated in your inbox that you no longer need and can have a smaller amount of emails collecting in your inbox.

I rarely have to use the search bar to find a past email. Just scroll down a bit and find the emails I need, because no clutter. 

If you prefer to keep the mailing list, another good tip I would give would be to have a separate email from your work email for mailing lists (have read some people actually don’t do this surprisingly). This would be more time consuming to organize (having to unsubscribe AND resubscribe), but can still be done slowly each day. This is especially helpful when you need to find that one email by that one client you can’t remember, but need. Less emails to go through makes for an efficient workspace (at least in my opinion). 

With work emails, you’ll rarely get all the way down to 0 emails. The goals here is to allow your inbox to be solely work-related and less stressful from extra clutter.

LifeProTips,"disclaimer I am not a professional in how phones work or how dust works. My research consists of personal experience and one or two google searches.

Dust builds up in all the little nooks of your phone. Your charging port is the worst because everytime you stick a charger in you’re pushing the dust and it stays there, until eventually it’s so dense that your charger won’t fit properly. 

At that point most people think the problem lays in either the port (well the problem is *literary* in your port) or the charger, so if you have problems with charging your phone and your charger looks fine, consider peeking in your phone’s feeding organ before wasting your money.

Your speakers also need to be cleaned because the dust will block the speakers and your music starts to sound muffled. It’s amazing how much this dust can block soundwaves, it could be a sound insulating layer in your walls so you don’t hear your neighbor’s dog.

Also if you have a mute switch clean that as well because in the bad case scenario’s both sides are filled with dust so it doesn’t work.

I don’t know the best way to clean everything. I use a wooden toothpick because it won’t scratch anything but is still stiff enough to scrape the dust (there’s probably a better way to do this).

LifeProTips,"Most people will find themselves in situations at school or work where they will be asked to do something extra, such as an additional assignment or role. The mistake that many make is to try to avoid doing anything and offer nothing else. This may work in the short term, but it may compromise productivity, relationships, opportunities, and so on. If something has to be done, everyone looks bad if no one steps up. You look extra bad if your superiors or peers put the pressure on you but you don't have a valid reason why you can't take that assignment.

What you should instead do is lock yourself into a role that you can't be moved out of. This role may not be fully desirable, but it could be something you'd prefer to do over the other option, and it can be a long-term strategy.

Early in my career, I decided to protect some of my time by applying to head the portfolio of a specific school program that I wasn't particularly good at or enjoyed, but it was something I could do. Over the years I became very good at that role, and thrived in the challenge. Not only did it become fulfilling, as the only person who succeeded in the role, it also made me a protected species when admin scraped the barrel for other positions.

I recall the school principal getting so desperate to fill a specific position that everyone who walked through the staff room was pulled aside for a conversation. I was one of them. I was seated and asked point-blank, ""Have you considered the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ role?"". I paused and replied, ""I'm not one to decline opportunities, but I'm already doing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_"". The principal nodded and said ""You're right. We need people who know what they're doing in that role.""

In other words, she went from interrogating me about why I don't want to do the role to saying that I'm more needed in my other role, because it's harder to replace me. I still occupy that role today. While my colleagues are hard-pressed to wiggle their way out of certain roles, I'm virtually untouchable as no one else wanted the role I volunteered for.

You can't always keep yourself protected, but you have a stronger bargaining chip compared to someone who hasn't put their hand up for something. By putting yourself up for roles while you can still choose them, you can say no to others and still look like the good guy.",LPT: Avoid being nominated for undesirable tasks by nominating yourself for other tasks first.

A vast majority of medical providers will not send you to collections if you stay in contact with them. Most organizations will write off all unpaid claims after 12-18 months so they will accept anything you're willing to pay.

Almost every single injection or drug administered via needle or IV will get reimbursed less than $1.00 by insurance unless it's a vaccine. Fight those the hardest. Insurance pays about 2% on average on those.

The best thing you can do is delay the payment as long as possible if you can't afford it. This was bad debt adjustments and contractual adjustments have been factored in.

Supplies used for your visit cost roughly $6.00 on average. This includes needles, any vital checking equipment, swabs, etc...

Average single doctor rates are around $105-$120 for an MD and $50-$55 for a PA/NP. If you get a PA/NP you can fight the cost more due to insurance applying a 15-30% discount on those.

Front desk employees average $10-$15 an hour.

Nurses average $15-$25 an hour but there time is usually less than when the doctor is in there.

Factor all of this into your required assistance. Please note that some providers will be different and some practices bill at lower rates. For the most part this should be a good general guideline to fight your medical bills the best you can.

The exception here is if you sign up for services at let’s say eBay. They’ll start you on marketing emails. Those unsubscribes are legit and work. However, most services you sign up with have a place in your account where you can change the settings on emails you receive. 

Furthermore you should get a plugin that analyzes your headers.

LifeProTips,"I've been seeing results of studies posted lately where they'll claim that when X was practiced, Y was observed, and even provide a large sample size like n = 4000. I suppose everybody is aware that sample size matters, but just having a large sample size doesn't prove anything.

For a basic silly example, let's look at a fictitious study that claims that when children were fed chicken nuggets, it was observed that they performed better on a math test (n = 2,450). You could could totally pull off such a study where you have 1,225 randomly selected kids write a test without being fed nuggets (Group A), and then feed the other half of the kids nuggets (Group B), and have them write the same math test and compare the averages. I'm sure you can find multiple issues with this methodology, but let's assume the groups are quite similar and look at just the simple theory. 

Suppose the nugget eating group ends up with a higher average on the test. Group A averages 60%, while Group B averages 62%. Did your study actually conclude anything? In order to answer this, imagine if you were to repeat the experiment over and over. If chicken nuggets really do improve test scores, then you would expect to find that most of the time, the Group B average is higher. It's not unreasonable that maybe once in a while Group A will do better due to chance, but if the nuggets really do work, then when you repeat the experiment over and over Group B should come out on top more often.

Of course, it's not practical to repeat the experiment over and over. So, the question becomes, what can we do with this single positive test? The answer lies in looking at the variance in each group as well as the average. For example, if Group B scores 2 percent higher, but the standard deviation of each group is tiny (e.g., all of Group A scored between 59.5% and 60.5%, and all of Group B scored between 61.5% and 62.5%), then you have a much stronger case for nugget powers compared with a situation where there is a lot of scatter in each group. 

There is a method used in inferential statistics that does exactly this, looking at the means and variances of each group to determine how strong a case the test makes. I won't go into the mathematics of it here, but if you're unfamiliar you should at least be aware that sample size alone means squat, even if the sample size is very high. When comparing two groups, you need to consider sample size, how different the means are, and the variance in each group. More complicated types of experiments exist too.

How do you know if the findings of a study are valid? Really, you have to ready the study and examine the methodology and results. Even if the methodology seems sound (I bet you can find some issues with my chicken nugget study before even considering results), you need to look at the results and look for what is called a P-Value. Again, I don't want to go into the math, but P-Values take into account everything I mentioned above and indicate the significance level of the test. Smaller P-Values are more convincing, and P-Values of under 0.05 and very commonly thought to indicate convincing findings. If you don't see P-Values in the findings, then the study is bogus.

Unfortunately, sometimes it's too easy to see a test with a positive result and a large sample size and think that's good enough. It's not. Always be critical and always read the study, even if the finding seems obvious.","LPT: Be extra wary of study findings, even if they seem backed up by statistics."

LifeProTips,"There’s a rule most sane New Yorkers go by to stay safe when dealing with crazies in the city. The rule is: do not engage. No matter how badly you want to say something or do something or retaliate, even if it’s verbally — it’s best to just ignore it. 

Same goes for online arguments. You’re not gonna get the other person to see your side, not ever. You’re not going to make that person think about their bad behavior or choices. So just like if you were in NYC: do not engage, do not feed the trolls. 

Same thing also goes for relationships that have turned sour. You’ll get over your negative feelings in time, but others will never get over how you negatively treated them and retaliating, even just verbally, is setting you up to have a huge fallout. Instead, either kindly divert the conversation to something else, or slowly fade into obscurity. You never know when you’re going to have to deal with this person again, such as a professional setting, and you do not want them talking trash about you to others.

Yes it sucks its unpaid but hey it protects you from having no source of income by being fired. 



Ill use myself as an example. I was diagnosed with Chronic migraines at 18 or 19, I had been working fulltime for over a year and migraines were starting to take a toll. I was missing work and had quite a lot of doctors visits during work days as well but didn't have the ""paid time off"" (PTO) to cover them. My employer did not allow ""unpaid time off"" because sick days and vacation days were lumped together so any day I missed beyond my PTO would result in an infraction. I used FMLA to be able to go home before I couldn't drive from a migraine and to visit the doctor/ER/Urgent care. My husband also used FMLA to take care of me while I had a migraine. I wasnt able to return to work after my migraines took a turn for the worse so now he uses it when I need to go to the doctors because I no longer drive from migraines.



Quite a few employers also have short term disability and long term disability insurances for their employees (Different than social security disability) now I got short term disability when I finally had to stop working.

LifeProTips,"“Never chase a woman.”

Great for attracting her initially.

But once you’re dating or in a relationship, it can actually harm you.

I am going to explain why this “Never chase a woman” principle isn’t black and white.

I also made a video to help you remember these principles fast. (Combining text-based and auditory information helps retention.)

Here is the link: [https://youtu.be/eNsK0GEW_4c](https://youtu.be/eNsK0GEW_4c)

\_\_\_

Chasing like a rabid dog is bad.

But so is being too indifferent.

Let me illustrate with a personal story.

## Stage 1: Let her come to you initially

I met this girl at a club, chatted her up, and we exchanged numbers.

The next day, Anna texted me first.

She chased me and I didn’t need to chase her at all.

That’s how I attracted her.

1. She felt safe knowing I wasn’t a stalker. “There’s no risk for me.”
2. Her interest went up because I was mysterious. “Why doesn’t he blow up my phone like all those other dudes?”
3. My patience communicated strength rather than neediness. “He doesn’t need me and that’s so sexy!”

Morgan Freeman said:

“Don’t chase women. They’ll chase you. If you see a lady and you don’t go drooling all over her, she’s gonna wonder why.”

Initially, being indifferent helped me attract Anna.

But soon, it stopped working.

## Stage 2: Open up while dating

As we dated, I kept playing hard to get instead of opening up slowly.

It’s not that I now had permission to blow up her phone.

But I had to get involved in the relationship emotionally:

1. I am a macho man all the time → I can be vulnerable sometimes.
2. I have options with women → I might have other options but I choose her over them.
3. I have higher priorities → Although she’s not my number one priority, she is becoming more important.

And what did I actually do?

I overdid the “Never chase a woman” principle.

I was a cold fish and had a hard time bonding.

## Stage 3: “Chase” gently as a leader in a relationship

Still, we dated for two months and became a couple officially.

And that’s when I did the most stupid thing.

We were on a trip to Rome and stood in a line to visit St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican.

I found a shortcut but she didn’t follow me.

And I left without her.

We lost sight of each other and spent the rest of the day apart.

I was way too indifferent.

I thought, if you don’t want to go with me, that’s fine, I don’t care and won’t persuade you.

But I should’ve discussed the matter with her patiently and worked out a solution together.

As a leader in a relationship, I need to do that gentle “chasing”.

Communicate instead of saying, “I’m a macho man. I am leaving.”

Another common situation is when your woman shuts down and you need to “chase” to open her up.

If you ask, “What is it?” just once and then give up, she’ll think you don't care or aren't strong enough to break through the barriers that she puts up to test you.

## Recap

No, that’s not permission for you to blow up her phone.

My point is: don’t take any of the extremes—drooling over a girl and being too indifferent.

Recognize at which stage you are in a relationship, get involved emotionally, and be a patient leader.

Either is viable depending on whether you really mean to apologize or not. Obviously tone and phrasing is essential, but it is much harder to make the first sentence sound apologetic than the second.

Often times when I ring up or take orders I’ll do my best to give a coupon and if there isn’t one, if the person is extremely kind, I’ll give my employee discount.

Or maybe even just for free. 

There’s some customers who were regulars and consistently patient and kind no matter if their order was messed up or their wait time was long. Those people consistently got credits, refunds, or free items just as a simple representatives way of saying thank you.

We deal with assholes all day, all night. Yesterday a guy came into the store and started yelling at the top of his lungs and cussing out an employee over a $1 price difference.

The other customers inside who stood back and politely approached the employee at the counter got a credit on their account just for being so patient.

LifeProTips,"I currently drive a 2019 Kia Rio and like a lot of new vehicles it is only available in an automatic transmission but allows you to manually downshift and up-shift the transmission sequentially. 

One of the most dangerous aspects of driving on slick, icy, or snowy roads is applying your brakes, your wheels are not spinning as much and can lock up or cause you to break traction especially at high speeds; hence the advent of things like ABS, and engine braking in manual transmission vehicles is one of the things you can learn to do to help you slow down without applying brakes, this is not only goof for MPG and efficiency but is also good for maintaining control of your vehicle on slick surfaces. But most vehicles now do not come in manual and properly engine braking can be hard to master in a manual car. 

You can do this with automatic transmissions as well, if you are in 6th gear and you know you need to slow down well in advance, instead of slowly applying your brakes, you can let off of the throttle and shift down to 5th gear and allow the natural slowing of the engine slow your vehicle down, rinse and repeat with lower gears until you reach the desired speed. This keeps your wheels turning and maintains traction in slick conditions. 

NOTES: This is something you would definitely want to practice a bit and get used to in order to do safely, always make sure you're indicating that you're slowing down by very lightly resting your foot on your brake pedal so other drivers know you're slowing down (some vehicles do this automatically) and finally I am not responsible for any damages or injuries suffered if you use engine braking improperly or illegally and cause an accident, study the laws in your area to understand proper and legal operation of a motor vehicle.","LPT: When driving an automatic vehicle on ice, with a little practice, a transmission that has a manual gear selection feature can help you get home safely."

We all see the posts on [r/getmotivated](https://www.reddit.com/r/getmotivated/) and the anger (sometimes justified) that happens with regards to injustices in life. I have seen a lot, spent my time in a psych ward years ago, had ribs broken, my nose broken, taken more serious psychological beatings, drank too much, did a fair amount of drugs, and have seen most of my childhood friends turn away because of my last name (dad is a high profile offender of the kind I can not mention on LPT). I have also had some awesome moments, like seeing James Brown live and Sigur Ros live, and watching my own children enter the world. I have made more than my fair share of money.

My story isn't super unique actually, we all have stuff going on and have all had our moments of sheer joy. I guess these are the drunk ramblings of a guy approaching (or in) middle age, but there is no substitute for just being a good dude. Looking back with, hopefully only, half my life over, I can't think of a time I regretted when I was awesome to another human being.

A couple of months before the year was over (1st year HS that is), I heard from a friend of mine (which he also bullied) that he would be moving to another state. When I heard it I became overfilled with happiness knowing that the worst of my school problems would be far gone in a few days. However things took a completely different turn. As it turns out I discovered that he was moving because his father had been arrested for getting involved with drug trafficking and his mother was dealing with drug addiction so he was leaving to go live with his grandparents. I’ve had a similar life situation as his. I was raised by my grandparents as well because my father was a drug user and dealer, and my mother couldn’t raise me alone (she didn’t use drugs, she was just unemployed and I was a “broken condom” child), so my grandparents “adopted” me when I was 5. When his last day in our school came, we took the bus like every other day. This day however he didn’t bully me like he would normally do, and instead was sitting in the back of the bus, all quiet and keeping to himself. We lived about 4 blocks away from each other and when the bus stopped at his house I came out of the bus behind him. He looked at me and said “What the f*ck do you want f*ggot?”. I said “Don’t worry, I understand”. I was waiting for a punch to land between my eyes but instead he just stood there looking at me. I went for it and hugged him. I said “I forgive you”. He didn’t say anything but I saw his eyes water a bit. Just writing about this makes me tear up a bit. I walked away and I’ve never seen him since. I don’t know what happened with him since then, but I don’t have any grudges or resentment from what he did to me. I truly hope it all went well in his life. I haven’t seen him anywhere on social media yet so I don’t know what happened after that. All I can say for all of you who have also been bullied in your life, is that bullying goes both ways. We can hate our bullies as much as we want, and it honestly takes a lot to forgive someone who hurts you. But in the end it feels amazing getting that anger out of your chest, and the best we can do is love those who hate us, because deep down they suffer too.",LPT: When I made my school bully cry.

LifeProTips,"I have a real problem with remembering stupid things I've done previously, dwelling on them, stewing and feeling really embarrassed, so much so the only way I could stop the thoughts is almost Tourettes like - by shouting 'FUCK OFF' at my bad thoughts, only in the car or shower on my own, mind.

However a while ago, I read that to deal with emotions it really helps to talk about them, but surprisingly it's just about assigning them words, so that it can move from a primitive part of your brain, and be processed.

I had been using this process to deal with a breakup. Literally, sitting there and going ""I am sad"", ""I am lonely"", ""I don't feel as attractive as I used to"" really helped, the next day 50% of my negative emotions were gone.

I then applied that to all these cringe, embarrassing memories that I have. For example: Halloween a few years ago my friends and I passed a guy dressed as Rick (Rick and Morty). I recall doing this terrible high pitched whiny impression of Morty in the guy's ear, he probably thought I was so strange and had no idea what I was saying, I didn't even say words!

So sitting on the toilet last week, I just said to myself ""That was weird, I feel embarrassed, it was bizarre. I bet that guy was really confused and thought I was strange. I feel like an idiot, I feel stupid"". And now I don't think of it in that painful embarrassing way anymore, it's just a memory and it doesn't affect me anymore.

Thoughts? I hope this helps, it was a surprisingly large part of my life.

LifeProTips,"Companies are going to start handing out Christmas bonuses this time of year. People may be immediately inclined to use this bonus to pay for Christmas gifts or something fun for themselves. However, there's a better albeit less-sexy way to use this Christmas bonus - pay off a debt.

Let's say you receive a $1,000 Christmas bonus. You can either buy an item worth $1,000 or you have a credit card loan. Let's say this loan is exactly $1,000, but it has an interest of 20%. Now if you decide to not pay off the loan and buy the present instead, you've spent $1,000. However, the credit card loan will have increased to $1,200 by this time next year.

Instead, you use the $1,000 bonus to pay off your credit card debt. The $1,000 has essentially paid off $1,200 worth of debt - increasing your overall bonus by $200 in gained wages.","LPT: If you use a Christmas bonus to pay off a debt with accruing interest, you have increased the overall worth of the bonus."
