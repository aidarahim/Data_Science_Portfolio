LifeProTips,"I work in the nonprofit world and every year we are inundated with good-hearted, kind people seeking to give back during the holiday season. The support and love is overwhelming, and makes us wonder, ""What amazing things could we do with this kind of support year round?"" Nonprofits and charities look forward to this time of year because we can share the labor of love that we do year round with our neighbors and community. Volunteers can help the people we serve feel connected and apart of their communities... Financial donations allow us to fund services or purchases that grant money does not cover.

If you are considering donating to your community to get into the holiday spirit, you can schedule your holiday donation during other times of the year when the need is especially dire. Food banks need food during summertime when children are out of school and families consume more food at home. Homeless day centers always need socks, underwear, white t-shirts, tampons/pads, or $10-$20 gift cards (many agencies use gift cards as incentives to encourage and recognize successes in the people they serve). If you have an old tent, sleeping bag, or camping gear, consider donating to a homeless provider so someone can live outside a little more comfortably. Any charity that offers beds to the community will gladly accept new/gently used sheets, pillows, or blankets. Even better is if you can call the agency and ask if they have any specific needs you can support them with. Every community is different and every agency has some weird, specific need most people don't know about unless you ask them directly.

If you don't know what charities are in your community or who to donate to, you can start by calling your local Social Services/Department of Family Services office and request a Community Resource Guide. These guides are meant to help someone in need who is unfamiliar with the area connect with local resources that can help them with food, shelter, and other needs. Urban areas usually have more resources, whereas rural areas typically depend on churches/faith-communities to serve the needy. Look through this guide and contact an agency or faith organization that supports a cause important cause to you. Ask them how you can support them or how you can volunteer to help the people they serve. Schedule your donation/volunteering during any other time besides winter, when the agency probably has less volunteers/donations coming in, and can plan ahead with your donation/time in mind.

Please don't hear me say the abundance of help and love that charities see during the holidays is unwelcome. Not only do we welcome it, it makes us wonder...

Could we end homeless in our community with this support year round?

Could we feed every hungry person in the city with this support year round?

Could we offer affordable medical treatment to every needy person with this support year round?

Could we safely house every fleeing victim of domestic violence with this support year round?

Could every needy child have a safe, fun place to play after school and during summertime with this support year round?

Could the people we serve, who often feel isolated and rejected, feel apart of and welcomed by their community with this support year round?

LifeProTips,"Services such as trash pickup, internet service, cable, etc. often seem to engage in price-creeping behavior (i.e., every few bills, the price goes up a bit for the same service).  Over the course of years, this can add up to a huge disparity between what you are paying with your current service vs. what you could be paying with a competitor.  

One good approach is to research competitors' prices and then call your current provider and ask what the procedure is to cancel your service.  Most customer service representatives will try to keep your business.  That's when you say that Company X offers the same/similar services for $Y per month and ask them to match that rate.  Your current provider will sometimes outright match $Y per month, especially when that lower prices isn't part of a limited-term promotional rate.  Other times, they will reduce your bill but not all the way to $Y.  (And, finally, sometimes they'll give you the runaround and then you can decide if the savings of moving to Company X is worth the hassle to do it.)

Source: I've saved over 50% on some recurring bills doing this (in 15 minutes or less...and didn't even have to switch to GEICO ;) ) and only rarely have been turned down outright.","LPT: Periodically call to renegotiate what you pay for ongoing services.

LifeProTips,"saw a post from /u/gesichtsbremse on reddit and it immediately worked so i figured i would pass it along to my fellow stuffed up redditors.
""This is just my little theory but it probably has to do with the oxygen supply in your blood.

It's a little known fact the swelling of the sinuses is actually regulated by the amount of oxygen or the lack thereof in your blood.

I did figure this out during a very nasty cold. I was wondering, why I could temporarily open my nose by doing push-ups. So I dug deeper. The result is that I now can open my nose consciously whenever it is stuffed in under one minute. It’s almost like a super power. Due to my constantly stuffed nose I used to be a mouth breather and also addicted to nasal spray. But not anymore.

All you have to do is to throttle your breath. Exhale completely and then start to breathe shallow and slow. It will feel a little uncomfortable in the beginning. But soon you will feel the same sensation in your nose, you feel when taking a nasal spray and soon after that your nose will open. One needs to exercise this a little, but soon it feels natural. Breathing into a bag should do the same thing, even though I have never tried this.

It all makes sense if you think about it. I was always afraid of what would happen if something would block my mouth, while my nose was stuffed due to a cold. In reality nothing would happen. Before dying from oxygen deficiency your body will make sure that your nose gets unblocked, no matter how bad your cold is.

So when you stand up, the amount of oxygen available at the brain probably drops due to a decreased blood flow (this is also why one sometimes get light headed when standing up) thereby triggering the constriction of your sinuses.

Tldr; read this post if you want to learn how to consciously unblock your nose""",LPT: Unclog your nose by simply throttling your breathing; by breathing deliberately very slow and shallow for 30 seconds your nose will instantly unclog

LifeProTips,"Cults are not just spooky religious organizations. They can be two-person relationships, groups, organizations, job-culture, or nations. The sign is that through a variety of ways you are ultimately taught to fear or mistrust the outside world or the outsider. This creates a situation where no matter how bad the cult-like situation gets, you see it as the lesser evil or the more reasonable option. Isolation from the outside means that a persons mental, emotional, and physical needs must come from the cult itself- further tying a person into it on a level that they might not be conscious of. 

If you realize you are in this situation it may give you the ability to distance yourself from it and/or unmask other red flags which may allow you to re-evaluate the situation you are in.

Understand that there are normal, petty instances of this type of behavior such as a jealous person telling you negative things- true or not- about another so that you become less attracted to that person and, consequently, may improve their own ambition with you. The line to be drawn here is difficult except to say that you should bot be in a situation where you feel increasingly cut off from the world in a relationship whose merit not only seems questionable, but increasingly detrimental to your comfort, if not your health.",LPT: Isolation via the propagation of fear of the outside or outsiders is a primary trait of cults.

LifeProTips,"Most students are unaware of many alternative ways of gaining college credit. Most students are familiar with AP testing but are unfamiliar with CLEPs and DSSTs. I highly recommend taking these your junior/senior year of high school or freshman year of college. Essentially, a CLEP/DSST test is similar to that of an AP course but you do not need to take the course offered by your school (and tbh, from what I remember from the only AP course I took, they are easier). The cost of these exams is $99 and it could potentially save you thousands. Check to see if your school accepts CLEPS/DSSTs at collegeboard. A lot of students thrive in a test-taking environment and this is a great way to challenge yourself and get rewarded.

If you are a high school student, take a CLEP upon completing a course. If you take a biology class, take the biology CLEP. Take a psychology class, take the CLEP... you get the idea. I would assume that many parents would be willing to fund or at least help out if they are asked. If you speak a second language, it can be worth up to 12 credits (usually towards electives) costing less than 10$ a credit hour. I would also recommend taking the following CLEPs unless you know the college you are going to does not accept them. They all have very high pass rates and require little studying. You are taking a gamble either way but I believe the 99$ risk is worth the reward.

CLEP College Composition (not modular)– 81% pass rate – worth up to 6 hours

CLEP College Math– 76% pass rate – worth up to 6 hours

CLEP Analyzing and Interpreting Lit – 75% pass rate – worth 3hrs

CLEP Principles of Management – 67% Pass rate – 3hrs

DSST Principles of Supervision – 95% Pass rate – 3hrs

Also, it is possible to study for multiple tests at the same time that counts towards different hours. (Once again, depends on your school) For example, if you are into computers I would take

DSST Computing &amp; Information Technology – 85% Pass rate

CLEP Info Systems and Computer Appl – 71% Pass rate

DSST Management Information Systems – 91% Pass rate

&amp;#x200B;

Here is an example of how much you could save at PennState. Picked this because it is a high ranking school with a more conservative transfer policy. You can get way more credits at other schools.

3CR - CLEP Humanities – Equivalent HUM 100N – 68% Pass Rate

3CR - CLEP College Mathematics – Equivalent College Mathematics: General—76% Pass Rate

3CR - CLEP College Algebra – Equivalent MATH 021--College Algebra I—52% Pass Rate

3CR - CLEP Management, Principles of – Equivalent MGMT--Introduction to Management: 3—67% Pass Rate

3CR - CLEP Marketing, Principles of -- Introductory Marketing: General – 79% Pass Rate

3CR - CLEP Information Systems and Computer Applications – Equivalent CMPSC 100--Computer Fundamentals &amp; Applications – 71% Pass Rate

3CR - DSST Fundamentals of Cybersecurity -- SRA 221- Overview of Information Security—67% Pass Rate

3CR - DSST Management Information Systems – Equivalent MIS 103--Micro Applied Business—91% Pass Rate

3CR – DSST Principles of Supervision – Equivalent MGMT 150--Supervision Management – 95% Pass rate

3CR – DSST Human Resource Management—Equivalent MGMT--Human Resource Management: -- 88% Pass rate

I don’t think there would be an issue fitting all of these into a business degree. There are even more CLEPs to choose from. These are just CLEPs that I have taken with very high pass rates. ( Tests are free to military so I use to take them all the time)

Total Credit Hours: 30

Total Cost: $990

Cost of 30 Hours at PENNState: $46,230 ($1,541/cr hour)

You can finish an entire year worth of school for less than the cost of one credit hour at PENN State.

LifeProTips,"I was requested to make a post on this by someone because students are unaware of many alternative ways of gaining college credit. Most students are familiar with AP testing but are unfamiliar with CLEPs and DSSTs. I highly recommend taking these your junior/senior year of high school or freshman year of college. Essentially, a CLEP/DSST test is similar to that of an AP course but you do not need to take the course offered by your school (and tbh, from what I remember from the only AP course I took, they are easier). The cost of these exams is $99 and it could potentially save you thousands. Check to see if your school accepts CLEPS/DSSTs here [https://clep.collegeboard.org/school-policy-search#](https://clep.collegeboard.org/school-policy-search#) . A lot of students thrive in a test-taking environment and this is a great way to challenge yourself and get rewarded. 

If you are a high school student, take a CLEP upon completing a course. If you take a biology class, take the biology CLEP. Take a psychology class, take the CLEP... you get the idea. I would assume that many parents would be willing to fund or at least help out if they are asked. If you speak a second language, it can be worth up to 12 credits (usually towards electives) costing less than 10$ a credit hour. I would also recommend taking the following CLEPs unless you know the college you are going to does not accept them. They all have very high pass rates and require little studying. You are taking a gamble either way but I believe the 99$ risk is worth the reward.

CLEP College Composition (not modular)– 81% pass rate – worth up to 6 hours

CLEP College Math– 76% pass rate – worth up to 6 hours 

CLEP Analyzing and Interpreting Lit – 75% pass rate – worth 3hrs

CLEP Principles of Management – 67% Pass rate – 3hrs

DSST Principles of Supervision – 95% Pass rate – 3hrs

Also, it is possible to study for multiple tests at the same time that counts towards different hours. (Once again, depends on your school) For example, if you are into computers I would take

DSST Computing &amp; Information Technology – 85% Pass rate

CLEP Info Systems and Computer Appl – 71% Pass rate

DSST Management Information Systems – 91% Pass rate

Here is an example of how much you could save at PennState. Picked this because it is a high ranking school with a more conservative transfer policy. [https://admissions.psu.edu/academics/credit/](https://admissions.psu.edu/academics/credit/) You can get way more credits at other schools.

3CR - CLEP Humanities – Equivalent HUM 100N – 68% Pass Rate

3CR - CLEP College Mathematics – Equivalent College Mathematics: General—76% Pass Rate

3CR - CLEP College Algebra – Equivalent MATH 021--College Algebra I—52% Pass Rate

3CR - CLEP Management, Principles of – Equivalent MGMT--Introduction to Management: 3—67% Pass Rate

3CR - CLEP Marketing, Principles of -- Introductory Marketing: General – 79% Pass Rate

3CR - CLEP Information Systems and Computer Applications – Equivalent CMPSC 100--Computer Fundamentals &amp; Applications – 71% Pass Rate

3CR - DSST Fundamentals of Cybersecurity -- SRA 221- Overview of Information Security—67% Pass Rate

3CR - DSST Management Information Systems – Equivalent MIS 103--Micro Applied Business—91% Pass Rate

3CR – DSST Principles of Supervision – Equivalent MGMT 150--Supervision Management – 95% Pass rate

3CR – DSST Human Resource Management—Equivalent MGMT--Human Resource Management: -- 88% Pass rate

I don’t think there would be an issue fitting all of these into a business degree. There are even more CLEPs to choose from. These are just CLEPs that I have taken with very high pass rates. ( Tests are free to military so I use to take them all the time)

Total Credit Hours: 30

Total Cost: $990

Cost of 30 Hours at PENNState: $46,230 ($1,541/cr hour)

You can finish an entire year worth of school for less than the cost of one credit hour at PENN State.

There are schools that have incredible transfer policies that are regionally accredited such as Charter Oaks State College, Thomas Edison State University, University of Maryland University College, Excelsior, and many other online colleges. Most schools, expect these to all be lower level. \*If you are interested in attending one of these university’s you can transfer 90+ credits using CLEPs, DSSTs, Straighter lines, ALEKs, Saylor, and other ACE credits for a total cost of under $3500.

LifeProTips,"I know this is not for most people since you have to take on the responsibility of paying your property taxes and home owner's insurance, but it's a great way to save money if you're on top of your finances. Also, I hear people say, ""you'll pay a higher interest rate."" It's true that your lender will try this to discourage you by doing this, but a good way around this is to let the cat out of bag the day before closing once your interest rate is already locked in. I've bought three houses and currently own two, and this worked every time! 

Perks of no escrow: 

1. Less money at closing. Based on national median home values, this translates to a fee of $2,000 to $4,000, which is added into your other closing costs. 

2. Any tax rebate you receive is applied to your tax bill as a lump sum for the full benefit. 

3. You're more likely to shop your homeowners if you pay it annually or bi-annually. I personally pay my homeowners annually and a $150 discount is more impactful when it's not spread out over 12 months. 

4. Possible discounts! My second home is in a state that gives a 2% discount to your tax bill if you pay it before the due date. 

5. More freedom with your money! The taxes on my primary home are due quarterly and annually on my secondary home. This reduces my monthly mortgage payments and increases my monthly cash flow. As long as you know how to budge, this will give you more freedom with how to spend your money. 

6. Your mortgage company doesn't always pay your taxes on time! If they're late, the interest is paid with your escrow funds!",LPT: You can forgo an escrow on your mortgage with a conventional loan to reduce the amount you need to bring to closing by a few thousand dollars.

  I'm a drummer, so I relate everything to drumming. When you first start learning drums people tend to think that being able to play everything is a mark of skill. As I got better I started to realize its not what you play, but what you don't that is a mark of skill. Knowing when to hold back and use silence in your rhythms shows that you have control. More so than non-stop playing. I have always been a loud and boisterous person, and kind of loved arguing and fighting (verbally). Im a righteous person, and will always stand up for what I believe. I always found it fun to argue  but at the same time I didnt know when to shut up and always ended up sabatoging my relationships with people. Recently Ive been having seizures (which i believe is do to stress and untreated anxiety) I was put on a medication that along with stopping seizures had made my anxiety disappear. The last seizure was truly terrifying and kind of made me realize we can die at any moment. Well anyway I had a realization(which I cant believe took me this long) that the idea of its not what you play on drums but what you don't that is a mark of skill and control can and should be applied to what you say. As of late instead of non stop arguing and defending my positions I've just been going silent. Letting the other person rant. Or not reacting to peoples attempts to fire me up,( i have a bit of a reputation of being a dogmatic asshole) I must say that my mood has improved drastically and I hold much more control over situations by knowing when to shut up. What's even crazier is I can see confusion in some peoples faces now that I have stopped reacting. I feel like I have finally mastered control of my emotions. In doing so have stopped myself from being emotionally manipulated by everyone and letting every little thing bother me. Sorry for the long winded explanation.",LPT: The power of silence

LifeProTips,"I'm a veteran, and I work for a VA eye clinic (not a doctor, just an ""eye tech""). I see probably 15-20 patients per day, and recently, we've been getting a lot of older patients who are new to the VA system. I've heard something to the effect of ""I wish I'd have enrolled sooner"" from a lot of these vets. Most of them had medical insurance while working, then retired and figured Medicare and a supplemental insurance would carry them through retirement; then a major health issue appeared, and suddenly, that Medicare and supplemental insurance wasn't enough. It became a game of ""do I buy food, or do I get my treatment and medications?"".

By the time these vets decided to get into the VA system, it was a pain in the ass for them to obtain their DD-214 and military medical records. They have medical problems that have crept up on them well after their service obligations were completed, which further complicates things, especially when trying to determine service connection for some of the issues.

Trust me; I've read all about the VA's shortcomings; thankfully, in our eye clinic, we're mostly vets who actually give a shit about our patients and get things done; I think I can say the same about the other clinics at my location. The veterans who have told me ""I've had nothing but great things to say about the VA"" far outnumber those who had negative experiences; I've been with the VA just shy of five years, and I'd never work anywhere else.

Veterans, brothers, sisters, do yourselves a favor. Apply for VA benefits, even if you don't use them right now. You'll already be enrolled, your medical history will be in the system, and all you'll ever need to do is say that you need an appointment. I'd honestly like to help every veteran that I can with getting in, but I'm just an eyeball guy. I'm a veteran who helps other veterans see.
