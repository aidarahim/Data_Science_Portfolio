A:   Yes. The Commission adopted rules on December 13, 2011 that require commercials to have the same average volume as the programs they accompany.  The rules became effective on December 13, 2012, one year after the date of their adoption. Broadcast television stations and pay TV providers were given until this date to be in full compliance.

**The Commission will rely on consumer complaints to monitor industry compliance with the rules.** You may report commercials that seem louder than the programming they accompany to the FCC at any time.  This information will help identify possible problem areas and will assist the Commission in enforcement of the rules.  Specifically, the Commission will use the detailed information from complaints to identify patterns or trends of noncompliance for a particular station, pay TV provider or commercial.
We recommend that you file your complaint electronically using the Commission’s online complaint form found at https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov

You may also file your complaint by fax to 1-866-418-0232 or by letter mailed to Federal Communications Commission, Consumer &amp;amp; Governmental Affairs Bureau, Consumer Inquiries &amp;amp; Complaints Division, 445 12th Street, SW, Washington, DC 20554.

LifeProTips,"I have done this countless times over the years. I go to quarries, constructions sites and other places that are going to be ripped up and ask to dig up the various flowers and other plants that are pretty and hard to come by (usually wild native plants). Most of the time they do not care if I do it before the job starts off work hours, they are going to bulldoze the whole place anyway. Other plant experts tell me these plants are not possible to transplant but they often thrive when I transplant them. The key is to just get as much dirt around them as possible. Basically as much as I can carry I dig around and down so much so the plant does not even know it has been moved as none of the roots are disturbed. I then plant it in as close to the same conditions that I found it in as I can get. At the planting spot I dig a big hole and churn up a bunch of muck and water to thoroughly soak and then plop the large dirt ball in and water it thoroughly so it all settles like it was never moved and care for it carefully from then on. These plants often thrive for years after I do this.

One word of advice though: make sure you know the invasive species, diseases, and various pests in your area before doing this as you do not want to bring that stuff home accidentally and never bring home plants from far from your home as that can do significant environmental damage and bring things home that can ruin your yard. When in doubt check with your local experts or the DNR. Also do not dig up wild plants from the forest and wild places as this is not only usually illegal but can be harmful to the environment.

Edit: I should mention this will be a ton of work to transplant a sensitive plant as the dirt ball will be heavy and if moved incorrectly will fall apart possibly killing the plant. Sometimes I dig a sort of small tunnel big and deep enough for my arms under the plant and tuck a big burlap tarp under it to make a sort of sack to go around the dirtball as I lift it. The key is to move so much dirt in such a way the plant does not even know you moved it. Sandy soils are harder to do this than more heavy clay soils that stick together better. Particularly big plants you may need to use leverage and a rope pulley system or basic home made hand crane to lift it into the back of a vehicle.","LPT: plants that are often considered ""impossible to transplant"" often just need a bigger dirt ball to survive."

Breakers work by releasing when they get too hot, from max current being exceeded. If the load on the circuit is hovering close to the trip point for too long it can also trip the breaker.

 Obviously this means you should take some of the load off this circuit, but if it doesn't initially reset, it may not be from a short circuit. It may just need to cool down to be able to hold again.

Researchers call the performance decline due to switching tasks the ""switching cost"". The cost is higher as the tasks become more complex.

In a study involving people who considered themselves heavy multitaskers and people who were light multitaskers, it was concluded that heavy multitaskers were worse at organizing their thoughts, ignoring irrelevant information, and had a higher switching cost (Ophir, Nass, &amp; Wagner 2009).

* listen to quiet and relaxing music or even good reading helps you to fall asleep and will also have benefits on the duration and depth of sleep;
* if you practice physical activity, the right time is evening, it can facilitate sleep by removing stress;
* once you turn off the lights, you no longer check the time, even if you wake up in the middle of the night. If you do that, you’ll start to think about how much time you’ve already spent in bed and how much left until you wake up, creating more anxiety and keeping you awake longer;

Me and my brother own a PS4, and thanks to Sony’s primary user feature, you can allow all users on the same console to play games you purchased on your own primary user. Simply make a primary user swap, in witch your friend/relative is a primary on your PS4, and you are a primary on theirs. You can still use your personal user on your PS4 with all its capabilities, and download and play all the games purchased by your friends/relatives authorized user, they can do the same as well. So basically when they purchase the game, or you do, you both can use the use that purchased the game on your console to download the game, and the play with your own user after its done downloading. You play with one copy, split the price, and won’t face any issues playing together online. I never did, and I’ve had the PS4 since release date. 

Note:  that this only works on digital online purchases not hard copy blue ray disks as you would need the actual disk to run the game as opposed to a digital download. 

Basically a great way for parent/child , brothers/sisters, relationship, Best friends to share the $$$ of a game and enjoy it.

Trust me, you will hide this key underneath your car, completely forget that you've done so, and then 1 or 2 years later you will lock yourself out of the car and then instantly this will pop into your mind, you will crawl underneath your car, snag the key, and be so thankful and in the process save yourself a $75 locksmith visit.

Misplay and Fitplay pay you for playing games. It's not hard, you just look through their lists and pick some games to play. They give you points that can be traded in for various gift cards. You can max out on each game in a day, but there's always more games to choose from. 

Swagbucks works mostly the same way but for market surveys. The bonus to this one is that there's no cap to what you can earn in a day (or at least I've never hit it). They have a selection of related apps that I've mostly never touched, but I do legitimately like their SBLive trivia game. I'm a sucker for trivia.

I don't know what it's like in the other countries, but in Korea, enlisted men are basically treated like nothing. Meaning, enlisted men aren't to be trusted. This is why I had so much free time during my service.

Usually it took me about an hour to do my job. Which meant I had nothing to do for the following seven hours. I was crazy busy during exercises or conferences, but most of my life was pretty dull.

I used this situation to study. I put in a lot of time studying for the CPA exam. Also, I read a ton of books on different subjects.

LifeProTips,"Stomach aches and digestive issues are a very interesting thing; They can be caused by nearly anything (Stress, lack of movement, breathing wrong, wrong food or even rotten food). This can make them very hard to deal with. But there is a **low risk,** easy chiropractical adjustment, that can help anyone regardless of age, to get rid of them many times and even prevent them in the future.

&gt;**If you have problems afterwards or they come with throwing up or other symptoms, see a doctor. This is only meant for the harmless type of pain!**

First some background information, because this really isn't black magic. As you should know our intestine is constantly moving, it needs to do this in order to digest food properly. But there is one part of this system that is often causing trouble: The Cecum, the connection between the small and large intestine. It acts like a valve and if it tenses up (which our digestive system tends to do when something isn't right) it can and will cause many problems and everything will be slowed down and painful.

In order to solve this issue, you must perform what is known as a ""Cecum-Ileum adjustment"" . Here a simple step by step instruction on how to do that:

1.) Remove any clothes that are on top of your (or your patients) belly. You'll need to remove them in order to find the specific spot you will adjust.

2.) Lie down on your back (On a flat surface. The Couch or Bed will do)

3.) Draw a line between the bully button and the ""anterior superior iliac spine"" on the RIGHT Side. (That is basically the highest, frontal part of the hip bone!)

4.) Press on the point on the center with two fingers and slowly move down until you find a tender spot. If you found it, you will be directly above the Cecum.

5.) Now breath into your belly, so that it lifts up and down. That is called ""diaphragmatic breathing"" (The way you are supposed to breath! Not just with your Thorax!).

6.) While doing this press onto the Cecum with two fingers, while doing a rotating motion. Do this for 30 seconds, be careful to continue the diaphragmatic breathing! After that take a short break and try again 2-3 times, until you hear a ""growling"".

7.) This might hurt a little bit, but those are just muscles that are tensed up. If something was tensed up and you did it right, the stomach will growl. (You will hear it).

I hope this well help you and improve your life :)

Even getting hurt or ill within the same country but a different state can mean big bucks. It's pretty difficult to stay in-network when your provider doesn't exist outside your region. 

Internationally the rules are different based on where you're traveling. Some health insurance providers will allow you to modify your policy to an international plan for the duration of your travels while others will tell you to buy travel insurance for coverage.

LifeProTips,"If there's a beneficiary assigned to an account and you die, the beneficiary can immediately just ~~take over~~ liquidate that account, and it is theirs. That simple. (Edit: in the US. apparently different elsewhere)

If there is ***not*** a beneficiary on an account, that account goes into the deceased's estate. It then becomes part of the public record of what was in the estate and is subject to the probate process where creditors (often healthcare providers) get first crack at it before survivors get anything and before a will comes into play. Also, it will be months before the thing is settled.

It takes 5 minutes to fill out a short little beneficiary form that can make your survivors' task of dealing with your estate SO MUCH easier and more fair, and your wish of ""who gets my money when i die"" is instantly fulfilled.

Edit: hey mods, if this is too close to a legal tip, i understand. It's just a real important and practical one, especially now

Howdy!

We did this for my 96 year old grandmother, since we haven't been able to visit her.  We had to come up with a solution that would work for her, even though she's not in a position to learn any technology at the moment.

I bought an inexpensive tablet with a cellular internet connection from Verizon, and set it up so that it would automatically accept video calls over Skype from me and the rest of my family (the Skype app has a setting for that). Then I sanitized it, and dropped it off for her.

When we call, we're immediately connected. My grandmother doesn't need to tap or touch anything to answer the call. She just needs to keep the tablet plugged into its charger in a place where she can hear our voices when we call.

There was also no need to set the tablet up on WiFi, since it uses a cellular connection. For her, it worked ""out of the box.""  The tablet's cellular connection only costs us $10/month extra on our existing phone family plan.

My grandmother has really enjoyed it. 🙂

If anyone here wants to set up a tablet like this for a friend or relative, I've written up [some detailed instructions](https://tabletconnect.org/) explaining how to do it.

LifeProTips,"LPT for conserving energy in hotter climate

Turn on both your ac and fan, set it to 2-4°C (3-8°F) lower temperature than your desired room temperature for 10-15 minutes or if you feel the room is cold enough.
But keep the fan on, this will make the room retain the ""coolness"" for much longer if compared to not using a fan.

Works best at night in a 6x6 metre bedroom

By doing this while you sleep, you will use 1188kJ (0.33kWh) instead of 8640kJ (2.4kWh) if you turn on your AC for 8 hours (calculated using standard AC power of 300W and 35W fan)


Note : If you only have the AC, i really recommend you to buy a fan. Costs around 8-30 USD. My household used to only have AC for more than 8 years and i decided to buy fan again.

Edit : grammar correction is very much appreciated, thanks","LPT : Summer Tips, if you have both Air Conditioner and an Electric Fan, turn on both but turn off the AC 15 minutes later"

LifeProTips,"So I preordered the FFVII remake deluxe edition back in June through Amazon. In October I moved into a new house. I updated my address on Amazon. Last week I got the notification that my order was shipping from Amazon. Through USPS tracking I saw it was taken by USPS to be delivered on the 14th by 8pm. It was not. I checked detailed tracking and it showed like two pages of weird 'package was diverted' messages. I tried calling but their automated 800 number phone line only let me check the status of the package- In Transit. I called our local post office and the line rang for several minutes and then disconnected. In the end my girlfriend drove to the post office and confirmed that they have the package, but they said they can't give it to us. I need to pay a $10 service charge for the change in address so they can ship it to my current address. They also said this happens constantly with Amazon.

The worst part was just having zero idea as to what was going on.

TLDR; Amazon doesn't change the shipping address on your preorders, so make sure you go in and manually change them or you'll get charged service fees and get your stuff late.","LPT: If you preorder on Amazon and move, make sure you update your address for that order."

LifeProTips,"If the child says something like ""I'm gonna tell my dad on you, and he's the CEO of Microsoft!"" Don't go ""yes, totally"" in a sarcastic tone of voice. Instead, make it seem like you're really afraid of what they're gonna do, which will make them feel better and less rebellious. If they say something like ""I want some ice cream!!"" Then you also say ""I want some too, if you come with me then I'll get you some"" and maybe flash a bill at them (even if you're never gonna get ice cream). If they want to play something while they're running, tell them that you will play it along with them as long as they're quiet and continue to run fast. Usually, if these kind of kids do not get what they want, they won't do anything until they succeed.","LPT: If you're getting a spoiled child out of a dangerous situation (like a fire), and they keep complaining, then pretend like you agree."
