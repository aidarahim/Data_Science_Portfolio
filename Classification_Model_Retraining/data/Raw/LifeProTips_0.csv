When you zip up, place/hang the key ring over your riveted jean button. Your zipper should be all the way up or very close. Then button your jeans as normal with the key ring in place. The ring and how it’s looped over your button should be hidden by the flap of your fly.

New gyms are notorious for overcharging and may not entertain previous contractual agreements you had with your old gym.

Where are you going when you die? Do you think your a good person?  If so...
* How many lies have you told? * Have you ever stolen anything despite its value?
* Have you fornicated or entertained lustful thoughts (aka. committed adultery-of-the-heart)?
* Maybe you’ve never gone so far as to murder someone, but have you simply harboured hatred for another human being (aka. committed murder-of-the-heart)?
* Have you desperately longed for something you do not own, or that someone else possesses? (covet)
* Have you taken God’s holy and awesome name in vain, using it as a swear-word? (blasphemy), Have you remembered the sabbath day? There are some of the Ten Commandments.
Now, if God were to Judge you on the Ten Commandments, would you be innocent or guilty? 
--------------------------------------------- The Results-------------------------------------------
You and me, we have both broke God’s laws, we would be guilty, none are good but God. Since the fall of man, it is now embedded into our very nature to be dreadfully sinful, utterly disobedient, and outrageous rebels. Romans 3:23 says, “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God”. God is Holy and Just and will condemn guilty sinners, just as a Just Judge must condemn someone guilty of a crime. 
------------------------------------------The Consequence----------------------------------------
God’s law clearly displays our wickedness and the problem we have with sin. His standard of the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:3-17) expose our sinfulness. Romans 6:23 informs us of the wages of sin — death. By disobeying God who is Holy, Righteous, Just, Perfect, Sovereign, Eternal, by breaking His laws, we have earned death for ourselves (spiritually, physically, and perpetually for eternity). That was the bad news; Now we know nothing can create intelligent design, order, conscience, morality, but an external greater force, (Almighty God) can. Romans 1:20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: People know God exists, but suppress the truth in unrighteousness, John 3:19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. Some sources for Jesus: 500+ witnesses, 24000+ manuscripts, fulfillment of Biblical Prophecies, historical, archeological, scientific data, 9 ancient sources, Holy Scripture, etc. The Lord Jesus Christ's resurrection shows that the Lord Jesus Christ is the one and only way, truth, and the life.    HERE IS THE    +         GOOD NEWS!      +
---------------------------------The Ultimate Sacrifice and Victory-------------------------------
Though we’ve lied, stolen, blasphemed, lusted, and broke all God’s laws, and will be justly condemned to Hell if we remain in our sins, God is the God of Love whose mercy endureth forever, God does not want any to perish but for all to come to repentance, so God sent His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, (God manifested in the flesh), to suffer the wrath of God we deserved, then Christ died for our sins, was buried, and rose again on the third day conquering sin death and the grave! God offers salvation as a free gift, amazing Grace!
------------------------------------------- Our Response------------------------------------------
When we repent of our sins and trust fully in the Saviour to rescue us from our own sinfulness, we become new creations! “The old has gone, the new has come” (2 Corinthians 5:17)! Along with inheriting our new identity as a Christian, a child of God, an ambassador for the Lord, we are assured a place in Heaven and gain the desire and power to battle sin. Whereas before, we were held captive to sin, utterly powerless and given zero reason even to fight against it, now, we are slaves to Christ and His righteousness (Romans 6:18). This is where true freedom begins!
But, what exactly does repentance mean? And what does it look like to trust Christ exclusively.
Repentance is to reject your old sinful ways of living and make a 180-turn towards God and His good, righteous character/statutes. It means we feel the weight of our guilt before God and respond by sincerely apologizing for our wickedness, thanking Him for His pardon through the blood of Jesus, and living the rest of our lives to please Him — and Him alone.
To trust Christ is to understand that only He has the power and authority to rescue you from your sin. No amount of good deeds will save you; only His redeeming blood-sacrifice will. Not one person will make it to Heaven because of something they did. The credit for our salvation belongs entirely to the Lord. So, love Him! “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength” (Mark 12:30) because of Who He is and what He has done for you!
--------------------------------------------- Summary---------------------------------------------
To sum it up, here is a brief message of the Gospel: You’ve sinned; I’ve sinned; we’ve all sinned. Every single one of us needs saving and we can’t save ourselves; there is no possibility of earning our way to Heaven. Jesus Christ, the blameless Messiah, — truly God &amp; truly man — humbled Himself as a servant on Earth and died a horrible death, paying the penalty we rightfully deserved for our own sin. Three days later, He conquered sin/death once-and-for-all by resurrecting from the grave. Now, through Christ’s death and victory, we can be made alive (no longer spiritually dead). He paid our ransom, our fine, and triumphed over the power of sin so that we could do the same, following after Him. 
What do you need to do to receive this precious, totally undeserved gift of salvation? Repent and believe (Mark 1:15). Turn away from sin, reject your old way of life and place the entirety of your trust in Jesus Christ. Humble yourself. Quit being prideful, relying upon your own good deeds to get you through. Understand that He is the only way to Heaven and put your faith in Him alone to save you. Thank you for taking the time to read it, the person reading this, I care about you so much and there is nothing more important than your salvation,  and God wants you to come to salvation. Peace be with you. Love you!","Oh Please don’t die in your sins, we have all sinned against the Holy and Righteous God who will justly condemn us guilty sinners to Hell if we remain (lie, theft, lust, hatred, unrighteousness) but God sent the Lord Jesus Christ to suffer and die for our sins, bury and risen! Repent and believe!"

LifeProTips,"Dentists have a lot of power because most of us don't have much knowledge on teeth/gum health. I'm sorry dentists, but some of y'all can be real shady.

Just this week, I went to a new dentist in the state I just moved to and he diagnosed me with EIGHT cavities. I've never had that many in my life.  I was honest and informed him I hadn't been to a dentist consistently so I believe he took advantage of that fact. Despite the office having a decent reputation and a high quantity of reviews, I decided to get a second opinion as fast as possible, otherwise it'd cost me a whopping $2000 out of pocket. Lo and behold, the second dentist said my teeth looked great and that I only had ONE cavity. I still can't believe the difference.

Moral of the story: Don't let yourself be taken advantage of and scammed! Don't be afraid to get a second opinion, it might save you 15x the amount of money as it did for me!","If you are diagnosed with an abnormal number of cavities, get a second opinion.

In reality, it’s the other way around. Showing emotion is something only the strongest of people do because it is much more difficult to show how you feel in front of people than hide it.

LifeProTips,"Sometimes your desire is just to have something shinny and new, when you don't really need it. 

When you browse through used stuff, you don't have that shinny new factor and you end up realizing if you really need it.

If you do, you can still go and buy a new one. But seeing the used, sometimes dusty, out of the box stuff, makes you see more into the utility of the product.

I've been doing this for a while and it has really helped me. I'm not super consumerist, but even then sometimes I just want to buy something new. Maybe I go through a shop, see a shinny new keyboard and want to buy it. 

It's ok to treat yourself once in a while, but if you're unsure whether or not you should buy something, I think this will help you in your decision. 

Companies spend a lot on branding, marketing and design to grab your attention. Your focus should be, more often than not, on the utility, and not because something looks pretty and new.

LifeProTips,"As for a lot of people, this is what I used to do with my productivity journaling scheme:

1. Write out my focus for the next week on Sunday (or any day you choose to strategize)
2. Define deadline for each priority to be done
3. Update to my journal the progress of whether I have done the tasks or not
4. Reflect the whole process on Sunday and find improvement points for next week.

Sound good eh?

It doesn't work if you are a procrastinator and extremely easily distracted... like me.

After any given Wednesday, the plan has usually failed. I don't update the progress daily. I pushed off the task to the next days and made Thursday, Friday and the weekend suffer for the low productivity of Mon, Tue and Wed.

And with rushing the deadline in the later days of the week, the planner have become something of an ideal expectation of how the week should be, versus guiding me on what I need to be doing.

But one day, as I were looking through my Learning Journal, where I store all the learning points that I have amassed, I remembered again about the Pomorodo technique (25 minutes intense focus, 5 minutes break) and I thought what if I were to use journaling in the Pomorodo way.

25 minutes of working

5 minutes of journaling on what went well, what needed to be improved in the next 25 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

I implemented  that and found out it was super effective against distraction and procrastination. Since 25 minute sprints are light enough so I can start, and for the 5 minute break I dont open up Facebook and surf them, so I won't as easily distracted as I would normally be, and I can always constantly update on my improvement straight away (don't have to wait until the weekend to do this).

I was documenting the action as it were taking place!

This turns out to be effective at making me accountable for a workday (2 hours of intense work like that is more productive than 5 hours of dabbling around for me).

It's amazing something I have known for so long (the Pomoro technique) could open up a new way to be even more effective. I owe this to my Learning Journal. I would recommend everyone  to keep a Learning journal.

LifeProTips,"Physically, I'm overall fine for the most part. I'm 5'11, a slightly above average height in my area, am at a normal/average/medium weight, though I'm physically fit from jogging and swimming, am clean, and my hair looks decent. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I can grow no facial hair at all, and can grow very little body hair except the pubes, pits, and very light hair that's almost invisible on my arms and legs. I have literally nothing in the torso area. No back, chest, shoulder, stomach...nothing. My arm and leg hair can't even be seen unless sunlight hits or your face is right next to it. The only noticeable things are the pubes and pits, which are usually always hidden anyway, and it's not even that much compared to most other guys. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know some women may dig a moderately hairless look, but they are rare. Most women want ""men that look like men."" Almost no hair like I have looks ""prepubescent"", according to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing too, I can somewhat control, but would require me to change my activities in my daily life. My soft and smooth hands. I don't even moisturize or anything, my daily life and exercises just don't require hands on labor, and so they remain smooth.

LifeProTips,"This LPT comes from an unfortunate and scary personal experience. A few weeks ago, I had my first child. A good family friend who lives in rural Mexico, a mother-like figure for me, found out via social media and sent well-wishes on Facebook. I was anticipating hearing from her (and in the general haze of no-sleep of having an infant) when I got a call from a number not stored in my phone. My phone simply said ""Mexico."" I answered happily and immediately said, ""Hello [family-friend's-name]!""

I was greeted by a woman's voice in grief, claiming to be my family friend, begging for help. Then the phone was passed to a man demanding that I shut up and listen. After getting a ""yes"" from me that I was listening, he told me that he kidnapped for a living and that he knew I wasn't a wealthy man, so what could I pay ""to save [family-friend's-name]."" It all happened so fast that I was briefly bewildered. All I had flashing through my head were memories of this woman and infinite stories about how unsafe Mexico is. Then I calmed down. I told the guy: ""You aren't allowed to put me in a moral dilemma because *you* are doing the wrong thing, so I'm going to hang up."" Before hanging up on me, he bizarrely yelled, ""I'm going to burn this chapel to the ground!"" (Is this a way to get a ""Wait!"" from the religious he targets?)

Within a few minutes, I confirmed that our family friend was safe and sound in Mexico--by contacting her daughters. This asshole just happened to hit a random American's number at the ripest of moments. I answered the phone using my friend's name, so he immediately had the personal touch to his threat. But that's all it takes, right? He can make this call 200 times a day, and if just one person knows a Mexican, he can make a fortune.

Yes, yes, this somewhat obviously gets binned under all phone scams: Don't give *anyone* aggressively demanding money about *anything* over the phone. But I was totally unaware of this specific growing threat before I got the call, so I thought I'd flag it for others here. As a younger person who has been abundantly warned about such scams, I'll admit my heart was racing, and I can totally see how older people or the unaware could get caught up in the moment. Be careful, everyone!","LPT: If you get contacted by phone by a kidnapper claiming to have a loved one, you're almost certainly being targeted by a ""virtual kidnapping"" scam, and you shouldn't give the caller ANYTHING."

LifeProTips,"  If you are one of the chosen few who get by without using caffeine, nicotine, or any other stimulates, I applaud you. For the rest of us, I offer the following on how I get the most out of stimulates. Stimulates work best when consumed slowly over an extended period, and with lots of water. Killing an espresso in one swift (and glorious) shot will wake you up, but will also led to a crash 20-40 minutes later. However, sipping a coffee over the course of an hour will give you a constant stream of energy. The faster you consume coffee, the faster it builds up in your body, and the faster your body burns it; thus the sooner you crash. Drinking water alongside helps your body process the caffeine, and is good for your dental health. Coffee (and most other caffeine drinks) is highly acidic, and the residue left in your mouth can corrode your teeth. Rinsing with water right after a sip of coffee is good for them. 

I do not chew tobacco, but my peers who do use the same process. Small amounts over the course of the day to maintain a steady flow of energy. Too much all at once will cause them to start buzzing, and loose focus on their work. The body also builds a tolerance for nicotine. The more you chew at once, the less effective it will become in the long run. This is true for caffeine as well.

LifeProTips,"Hello all

I hope that i am going to post in right community.

Actually, i have some problem regarding my performance, mind, tension, stress, overload and other related terms.

From last 6 months, I am facing this issue.

Before 6 months, i was working on 2 marketing projects with full of creativity, production and execution. I was getting results from project and i was satisfied with my work because I was getting results.

After that, my company bond period came out and i was promoted to team leader position. I was very happy as i was learning many things like accountabilty, responsibilty of projects, managing relationship with clients, production of content and execution. These all skills worth for me and I found growth in my myself.

So, when i was promoted to team leader position, i learned many managerial skills and practised upon. My project manager gavee me 2 more projects to handle with my team. I said yes and i started managing 2 more projects. Projects were big as I need to manage all things from idea strategy to execution.

After 2 month of promotion, my project manager gave me 2 more projects which were very big in finance industry. The project was basically on marketing of fintech startup. I said yes and started managing with team.

Everything was going good and i experienced good amount of skills and learning.

But now from 1 month, I started feeling frustrating. Why? Because i need to do a lot of multitasking in projects. I need to manage relationship with client, i need to create strategy, content production and assigning to team with execution. I need to train the team as well for new strategy.

However, i was not like that before. Before, i worked with creativity and productivity with results.

But, now I feel multitasking is eating me, eating my mind, reducing my creativity, decrease in growth as I am not being able to focus on one thing at one time. I need to think and do lot of work at one time. Some tasks are dynamic which comes anytime and need to complete hand to hand, but i started feeling frustrated when I need to talk with client, assign works to team, creating strategy and many more work.

I know that multitasking has very disadvantages. I read blog on multitasking and productivity.

But knowing is not the solution. Whenever i think that i need to calm down and doing tasks with calm mind. But, it is very hard to keep mind calm. Meditation is also helping me for only limited time. Now, it becomes a habit of frustrating and irritation. Sometimes i got anger on my team for not doings tasks perfectly.

Taking stress of work, irritation, frustrating is really bad for my health. Satisfication from work is almost Zero. I think that I am not growing in my carrier as i am not able to focus on one thing because of multiple projects.

So, my question is how to recover from the current situatuon? What is the solution to reduce my work? How to become more productive, energetic, creativity like I was before?

I need a practical solution on this. I know that here are experts peoples who have experienced many things in their carrier and business.

Please help me! Thanks in Advance! Happy Helping!",How to recover creativity and productivity? How to get rid of multitasking?

LifeProTips,"So we all know that in order to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, one must **simply** multiply the original value by 1.8, and then add 32.   

But what if you, like me, just want a rough conversion of the outdoor temperature without having to mentally multiply by 1.8 - or even worse, having to use a calculator? There must be an easier way to get from one to the other, quickly, without compromising the integrity of the conversion itself.   

I present to you: The Hillbilly's Guide to Conversions. From Celsius, you double your starting value, subtract the first digit from itself*, and then add 32.  Examples:  
  

* 0C: Approximate conversion: 32F.  Actual conversion: 32F   
* 10C: Approximate conversion: 50F. Actual conversion: 50F  
* 17C: Approximate conversion: 63F. Actual conversion: 62.6F   
* 22C: Approximate conversion: 72F. Actual conversion: 71.6F  
* 26C: Approximate conversion: 79F. Actual conversion: 78.8 F  
* 35C: Approximate conversion: 95F. Actual conversion: 95F  
* 39C: Approximate conversion: 103F. Actual conversion: 102.2 F  
* 48C: Approximate conversion: 119. Actual conversion: 118.4   


*But SelectFrequency, how is this faster or easier than the original method? Does the perceived ease or expediency compensate well enough for the inaccuracy?*  

Well, of course. I - *clearly* a genius - have to actually stop what I'm doing and think, for several seconds, before *maybe* correctly multiplying 37 by 1.8. Go on, why don't you try, right now, in your head, to multiply 37 by 1.8. You can do it, but it's gonna take a minute.  

Now instead, take 37 and double it. Great. 74. Now subtract 7. Great. 67. Now add 32. Great. 99. The actual conversion of that is 98.6 - and if you can't be off by a few tenths when dealing with the weather, then is this really the America we want to live in?   

__   



*In instances where one is converting a Celsius temperature higher than 50, it is instead necessary to subtract the first *two* digits from itself, as you will at this point be left with a three-digit number. For instance, if one were approximating the conversion of 59C, you would double 59 to equal **11**8, and then you would subtract **11** from 118, leaving you with 107. You would then add 32 to get 139. The actual conversion is 59C = 138.2.","LPT: Need a quick, on the fly, ""close enough"" conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit? Starting from Celsius: double it, subtract the first digit from itself, add 32. Starting from Fahrenheit: Subtract 32, halve it, add the first digit to itself"

LifeProTips,"This tip might seem a bit backwards, but I've found it a great way to save money.  As a general rule, I never buy things just because I saw them on sale.  This means I've sworn off black Friday, Prime Day, etc  If I need something, I buy it, and if I can't stomach the sticker price, I don't buy it.  It's tempting to see an item go on sale and rationalize the purchase, saying ""I was going to buy that anyway, at this price how could I not?""  You _weren't_ going to buy that item until you saw it on sale, so you clearly do not need it, and you're not saving any money buying it now.  If you buy a $100 dollar item for $75, you're not ""saving"" $25: you're spending $75.

Try this if you tend to buy a ton of stuff because you can't resist a good deal.  The only exception to the rule is if you were literally in the process of buying item and discover a sale, like at a drugstore or supermarket, where often discounts are only made apparent at the register.","LPT: If you're trying to spend less, commit only buying items at full price, unless you discover a discount during the purchase. This will prevent you from making impulse purchases of things you don't need, just because you saw them on sale."
LifeProTips,"I'll provide details here as I know this sort of thing requires it. While I could've put ""financially"" in the title as well, I think becoming emotionally/mentally independent is the more pressing issue. Anyway, let's begin. I'll be as concise as possible:

I'm currently 25 years old and still living with my parents. I have the ""life smarts"" of a 15-or-so year-old. I'm autistic, but not severely, so I consider it mostly a nonissue.

I did not go to college, mostly due to the sheer amount of non-refundable money I would need to spend (yes, I'm in the US), and the time commitment. Also, it seems to me to be a gamble that may not pay off, and I just cannot risk that.

I never learned any important life skills during my formative years, either from school or from my parents. These include cooking, money management, basic maintenance, and others. 

Before you ask me ""Why don't you progress?"", believe me, I've tried. Back in high school, I applied for a job at the local grocery store. They didn't contact me until it was no longer possible for me to work there. I went to a broadcasting school after high school in hopes of starting a career in radio. Frustratingly, there were no jobs to be found in that field, so I gave up on that last year. In the fall of 2017, I went to counseling in an effort to become independent. It didn't work.  I got my driver's license last year in hopes that that would be my ticket out of the house. It wasn't. Lastly, at the end of last year, I applied to a fast food place fairly close to me. The interview went well, despite a couple of hiccups. I did not get hired. I still have never had a job.

So as you can see, every effort I've made to progress in life has hit a gigantic road block, as I see the people I went to school with living their successful, happy, independent, and sometimes married lives and having no such problems. I know for a fact that there is a happy, successful, and independent man hidden deep inside me, but I have no idea how to awaken it. 
 
I'm getting teary-eyed as I type all of this. I'm getting to the end of my rope. I would never commit suicide, but I can't help feeling that I've lived all the life I can possibly live. I see absolutely nothing in my future, other than me continuing to stagnate with no way out.  So, with that in mind, how can I become emotionally/mentally independent of my parents and start living my life?
