Showerthoughts,"(43M) when I wash my anus it feels amazing! I end up soaping my anus for like 3-4 minutes straight. See I have hemorrhoids, which are essentially swollen blood vessels that are stretched out from straining while dropping the duce. I learned by accident that if you massage the anus it alleviates the hemorrhoidal inflammation through the process of massaging the anus. Apparently Nature made hemorrhoids itch for a reason. It feels freaking great! I actually look forward to shower time and don’t even mind the hemorrhoids anymore. Loads of nerve endings down there, no wonder the Gays are indulging they way they do! I even get goose bumps when I wipe my ass after a good bowel movement. 

¿¿¿Anyone else experience this???

Showerthoughts,"Seeing Elon Musk's plans for Neuralink as a exoskeleton of the brain and him wanting to make it so that you can receive information from the internet instantly when you need it, this made me realize that since if such a device was in the public that person with device can gain info about sports teams immediately, and it would ruin sports betting entirely to the point where it will be as dead as a prehistoric dinosaur as everyone with such a device would gain info about the most likely team in a bet that would definitely win.

Same thing could be said for horse racing (as info on each horse could be gained from the device instantly).

Las Vegas casinos (or any casino) will definitely be screwed in the future by this.

**(Or they won't allow those with BCIs in. It's obvious.)**

Don't forget about DraftKings and FanDuel. When BCIs become mainstream, legitimate fantasy sports players who don't have BCIs that made a shitload of money from their skill will be screwed and WILL have to get a BCI to continue succeeding for scraps.

Everybody else without a BCI will not make anything from betting.

This shit is ""mark of the beast"" tier right here.

tl;dr: In the future, people with a Neuralink device (or any other BCI in the future) can receive and learn info from the internet instantly. Since this will most likely include info about sports teams or horses, sports betting and horse betting becomes dead in a future because of this. If DraftKings and FanDuel continued to exist, players without BCIs will be screwed by players with BCIs like a ""pay-to-win"" upgrade. Eventually, everybody would have to have a BCI to catch up.
