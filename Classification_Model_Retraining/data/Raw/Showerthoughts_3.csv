Showerthoughts,"The song doesn't go, ""There is a farmer who has a dog""

It goes, ""There ***was*** a farmer who ***had*** a dog""

What probably happened was, one day, when the curious Bingo explored the woods nearby the farm, a raccoon bit Bingo and gave that dog rabies.

The farmer noticed this when Bingo came back to the farm.  

Alarmed at the rabid Bingo, the ol' farmer grabbed his shotgun one early morning, and took Bingo behind the barn to put him down, before Timmy woke up and wondered where his dog went.

Bingo, innocently enough, thought the farmer was just going to play a game with him—this time, just without Timmy.

The farmer aimed the shotgun at Bingo, knowing that the Lord would see things his way, and pulled the trigger.  But one shot didn't do it—at least, not right away.

""Ah! What the fuck!?!"", the rabid wounded Bingo thought to himself, in Dog.  Nature's fight-or-flight instinct kicked in for Bingo, and the rabid angry dog mauled the farmer to death.

Exhausted from mauling the farmer to death and increasingly dizzy and faint from the blood still seeping out of that bullet wound caused by the farmer, Bingo would faint, collapse, and eventually die alongside the farmer.

And this commotion and ado alerts the farmer's wife, Sally, who is wondering where Earl and Bingo went.  She sees their dead, pale, cold, lifeless bodies behind the barn, freaks out in hysteria, and calls 9-1-1.  Her call to 9-1-1 was recorded, like all 9-1-1 calls are.

The police show up to the scene, followed by the coroner, who was called by them.

The coroner asks the officer for the details on the two lifeless bodies in front of them.

Officer:  ""Well ...there was a farmer who had a dog, and Bingo was his name.""

Coroner: ""Oh...""","According to that children's song, both Bingo and the farmer are dead."
