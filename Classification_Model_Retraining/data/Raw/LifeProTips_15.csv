LifeProTips,"Pretty obvious, but when I started out - my resume had 7 internships (I know, a lot!) and very little full time experience as such. My combined full time internship experience alone was ~3 years, but due to word ""internship"", I was afraid I'd be seen as green still. So, I would try and twist the resume to make internships look as full time roles.   

Do NOT do that! It is obviously seen as a big red flag to be job hopping every few months.

For example, set a designated time(s) for Youtube/Screen time for the children. 

Set parenting reminders on how to improve as a parent. If I have an idea of a fun game for my kids, I set a reminder for the next day. Me personally, as a father, I set reminders on how to interact with each of my kids. I used to yell (still do) if my children did anything wrong. I have a reminder every day that simply says “Don’t do that”.  It doesnt always work, but I’m hoping constant reminders daily over time will help me to change. 

I also have reminders every morning to “Stay off my smartphone and spend time with my kids”. Before I usually browse Robinhood and Reddit in the AM while my kids have breakfast.

Set reminders for at breakfast, lunch, and dinner to stay off your smartphone and be in the moment with your kids, family, loved ones, guests.

As a candidate applying for a job internationally you might be asked to disclose more personal information than typically required, so how do you strike the balance between protecting your personal data and finding a job.

In Canada, there are very strict laws about the type of information that employers can request from candidates.

**What** **companies can ask:**

1. **Resume:** It is essential for[ ***resumes in Canada***](https://settlement.org/ontario/employment/find-a-job/resume/what-do-i-include-in-my-canadian-resume-what-do-i-exclude/) to include the applicants name, contact information, skills, accomplishments and relevant experience. Do not include personal information such as social security numbers, religion, marital statuses, not even your gender.
2. **Proof of credentials:** Credentials are expected to be placed at the bottom of the resume underneath a category labelled as professional credentials, academic credentials or along those lines. Examples may include academic degrees, certifications, or work-related licenses and clearances.
3. **References:** Do not include references unless the employer or job posting specifically asks for it. Typical employers like to see three to four references, with the strongest references listed as your first. With that being said, remember [***not*** ](https://www.livecareer.com/resources/resumes/how-to/write/should-you-include-references-in-your-resume)to include references on your resume unless it is being asked for.

**What companies cannot ask:**

1. **Marital status**
2. **Gender**
3. **Race**
4. **Religious beliefs**
5. **Sexual orientation**
6. **Height, weight or for photographs**

We have heard countless stories from international candidates who have fallen victim to immigration scams. In no instance should you as a candidate ever pay for a company to find you a job. Do your research on the company ahead of time and ensure that they are a legitimate business.

Regardless of the logos and names visible in the job offer, always protect your privacy while searching for jobs. For example, it is never required to share your real date of birth unless you are applying on an official government website. Please remember that no employer should be asking you for your mother’s maiden name, bank account number or your birth date. This is not to discourage applicants, but to encourage safe tendencies when job applying.

Moving to a new country is a big decision and it can be difficult to know who to trust with the process. Working with an agency that specializes in hiring and relocating international talent will help you navigate the potential pitfalls in the process — and that’s exactly what [***Global Talent Accelerator***](https://globaltalentaccelerator.com/) is here to do.

LifeProTips,"Every vehicle in the US after 1996 is OBD-II compliant.

To put it simply a Bluetooth OBD-II reader will allow you to plug it into your car, and connect to your car's computer system  via Bluetooth and use an app (such as Torque Lite) to read error codes.  This allows you to see what is causing your check engine light, see if there are any issues not serious enough to cause a check engine light or even just see some engine information you might not usually get (like fuel economy).  You can also reset your check engine codes so you can see if your fix actually fixed the issue or not as your car will propagate that information again over an hour or so of driving.  Good for fixes on the road, informing you (and possibly fixing anxiety) of what's going on with your car and possibly saving you a lot of money to pay a mechanic to do almost the same thing.

Your mechanic will be able to get more specific information by using their expensive (manufacturer specific) machine at the shop, but you can get general information using one of these cheap readers.  I.E. You might get an error like ""low compression"" and your mechanic might be able to get an error like ""low compression in cylinder 3"" but knowing what to look at, or be worried about is super helpful for on-the-road repairs.

This saved my ass on my last roadtrip as I was driving over the mountains (in my car from 2006) when I had a check engine light come on.  Pulled over, plugged the reader in and gave it a scan and found out my heater core was stuck open.  Some quick googling later and that basically meant the the valve that allows fuel to flow into the cabin heater system was stuck open and thus the engine would warm up slower.  Seeing as it was the middle of summer I didn't really care about this so I just finished my trip and got it fixed when I got home a couple weeks later.

LifeProTips,"This is a relatively old concept for psychoanalysis, invented by D. W. Winnicott. He focused on the idea that the best kind of mother for a child was the ""good enough"" mother. This mother made sure that the child's essential needs of feeling safe and loved, fed and sheltered, were taken care of and did not focus too much on other things. This allowed the mother to be a happier and more relaxed parent, not pre-occupied with perfection and the judgements of others, and not using the child as a narcissistic extension of herself. Children grew up emotionally healthier and mothers felt happier and more satisfied by motherhood.

Decide what are the necessities and do that, but don't try to strive for perfection because it puts the focus too much on the approval of others and sets impossible goals for yourself. This may seem like a good method for achievement - to shoot for the stars and maybe settle for the moon - but it doesn't work that way in the big things in life that we really judge ourselves by.","LPT: The best person is the ""good enough"" not the perfect because perfect doesn't exist and the pursuit of it makes you and everyone else miserable.

LifeProTips,"Hey guys,

This might be a common thing already but I have been using this easy trick for some while now and trust me, it works perfectly for deciding on any place you are supposed to pick. 

I have a long-distance girlfriend, with whom we meet only rarely. In these times, we want to make the best out of it but it is almost impossible as she is indifferent about where to eat for 90% of the time. The other 10%, she doesn't care. Being pushed to decide, I have always tried tricks like flipping a coin, telling her pros/cons, and even asking strangers on the street to pick!

This came to an end when I started pitching her that I have a great surprise for her and told her to get ready for a real thrill in the evening. When she got curious, I asked her ""Try guessing where I am taking you tonight"" and sometimes even nudged into a direction like ""which oriental place"" or ""which great open-air venue"". Obviously, after her listing one or two places with great enthusiasm, I called and reserved a nice table in those places (sometimes even before calling her I reserved in several places just in case and afterwards canceled it).

This mostly makes her happy and takes a huge burden off my shoulders :)","LPT: If you are supposed to pick a venue, just ask your indicisive counterpart to guess where you are taking them as a surprise"

LifeProTips,"Tipping your head backward can cause the blood to run down your throat which can upset your stomach. Tipping your head back can also cause the blood to back up into the pharyngotympanic tube (the tube connecting your inner ear to your throat) and cause irritation. Some people also experience irritation in their throat from the blood running down as well. Tip your head forward and hold a tissue under your nose with one hand and pinch just above your nostril with the other. This will allow a clot to form and stop any blood from dripping.

Pushing tissues or toilet paper or anything up your nose to stop the bleeding will, more often than not, make it worse. The bleeding is most likely coming from your septum not that far into your nose and causing any friction against it while it is still clotting will rip the clot out and make the bleeding start all over again.  

If you are unsure if it is still bleeding, gently press a tissue or something similar against your nostril and wait about 15 seconds and check to see if there is any blood on it, if there is, wait another minute or two and check again. Don't stick your finger or anything else up there to check. There will be blood on it regardless of whether or not is is still bleeding.

Be sure to not pinch your bone either. That hurts a lot and will do nothing to help.

LifeProTips,"This is something I wrote when I was on one of my road trips and at one of the happiest points in my life. Everytime I get into a life rut I reread it and remind myself to get out there and expierence life. Live for the now.



In the beginning of life your roadmap to living is pretty much given to you. You learn to crawl then walk and talk. You go to school for 12 years and in my case go to college afterwards. After graduating college you find a career and work until you retire and then get to enjoy life without work. I accepted this thought process at a young age and never really questioned it. About a year after graduating I began to doubt that this how things are supposed to be. I thought to myself “Is this really what life is? Going to work Monday-Friday, the occasional weekend out and then back to the grind the next week?” I realized that life had become monotonous, that even though I was only a couple years in to my career things felt dull. How could I possibly go another 30+ years doing this every day to finally retire and enjoy life? I became depressed by this thought and every night would think about what I was doing wrong and how I can change the way I feel.

In April of 2017 I had the biggest epiphany moment of my life. 50 miles. I was 23 years old and 98% of my life could be defined by a 50-mile radius. Yes, I did travel around 1 week a year but that means that 1,173 weeks of the 1,196 weeks I was alive were spent within a 50 mile circle of my home, going to school, going to work, going out with friends, rinse and repeat. I thought about how big the world was, how many places there are to see, people to meet, cultures to experience and memories to be had. It has been a short 21 months since I came to this realization. Since then I’ve spent nearly 2 months traveling. I’ve driven over 11,000 miles through 2 countries, 30 states and over 20 national parks. I’ve been circled by coyotes, accidently gone off-roading, torn muscles and winged things more times than not. I’ve backpacked through mountains, crashed on friends couches and stayed in the occasional hotel. I’ve seen and been to more places in less than 2 years than most people get to in a lifetime. But the most important thing of them all is that I got to do with friends and family that I love.

If you’ve never been on a true road-trip before then I would recommend everyone try it at least once. No, not the 12 hour drive down to Destin, a real road-trip. Find some friends, hop in a car and go. You don’t know where you will be tomorrow, all that you know is it’ll be something new. It’s a nerve wracking experience to start but it really makes you understand the old saying “It’s about the journey not the destination.” If you’ve ever taken a long drive with a friend after a few hours some of the conversations start to get weird, now spend 12 hours in a car with someone for a week straight, you get my point. You get to know your friends and family on a whole new level, talking about everything from life to aliens and stuff I can’t mention in this post. Over the years on the road with friends I have shared more stories and laughs, deafened a few with my repeated singing of “on the road again”, but most importantly formed an unbreakable bond with every single one of them.

Not to sugar coat things, I still spent 19 of my last 21 months working on my career, however my mindset on it all has changed. Instead of thinking and waiting 30+ years to retire all I can think about and wait for is 2 more months to hop in the car and go. Life is what you make it. Whether it is traveling that you find to be your passion or any number of other things, I guess my message to you is don’t live for the future, live for the now and most importantly ask yourself do you want your life to be defined by 50 miles?",LPT: Find your 50 mile barrier and leave it

If you choose either “no longer needed” or “bought by mistake”, it’ll likely prompt you to pick a method of how you wish to return the item.

and you want to do it as quickly and as effectively a possible. Here is how you do it.

1. Read all of the text slowly
2. Once you are done with that write the first letter of each word in the text (include punctuation and capitals) - W t p o t U S, i O t f a m p U, e J, i d T, p f t c d, p t g W, a s t B o L t o a o P, d o a e t C f t U S o A.
3. Now try to read the text by using the first word of each sentence\^. Do it 3 times to be sure.
4. Cover your eyes
5. Finally, while your eyes are covered, recite the text
6. Go back and read the text if you can't recite it 100%

LifeProTips,"This is not my idea. I don’t remember the name of the person who I saw do this but I do believe it is helpful and I wanted to share it. 

Take a jar/a small box/something similar and paint it however you like. You don’t even have to paint it if you don’t want to. Just as long as you like it, it’s fine. On the lid, you are going to come up with a name for the jar and it should be related to happiness. Mine is called “the joy jar”, and the guy I originally saw doing this named his “happy happenings” if I remember it correctly. You now have your joy jar! Now, every time something makes you happy, you are going to write it down and put that little note into the jar. It can be larger things, or very small things that just put a smile on your face. 

Why should you do this?

On the shorter term: whenever you are feeling down, you can take out the jar and read the notes. It will not solve your problem and you may still be a little down afterwards, but now you have reminded yourself that life is not horrible all the time. There are a few moments of light, and those are easy to forget if you are depressed. It is important to remember that you are able to be happy. 

In the long run: you have now set up a task for yourself, and will be on the lookout for things that make you happy so you can write them down because that is what you are supposed to do now. You are basically training yourself to notice the small things in life. I have been diagnosed with depression for a couple of years now and let’s just say things has not been easy. Although this has not cured my depression, not has it solved any of my large problems in life, it has helped me to notice the small, bright moments of life. It has changed my perspective on things. I am much better at noticing the small things and that lights up my days. 

I know it may sound lame but I recommend trying this if you often find yourself feeling down. It may not solve the problem, but it certainly helps (at least for me).",LPT: you should make a joy jar

So, I feel really crappy often with a slew of minor back and neck issues. Once I hit 30, it felt like every day something new is hurting. 

I started breathing mediation since I had a lot of free time during the pandemic and needed a cost-less excuse to step away from the computer when not working. I am something of a lapsed Buddhist, so while I don't believe in the spiritual aspects of meditation, I do believe in the practical benefits (and it's a whole lot easier than working out...though you should do that too.) You can do this from anywhere, any time, and requires minimal effort. It's less demanding than stretching.

Something I found interesting is, first day, first session of guided body scan and then breathing mediation, I was able to improve my posture in a way that was only uncomfortable for a few minutes, while the improvement to my back comfort and general body language lasted the rest of the day. 

The method:

1. Sit upright, put in the effort to have a straighter back than usual. It'll be uncomfortable for a few minutes, don't worry about it.

2. On breathing in just focus on stretching out your chest cavity and belly.

3. On breathing out, try to relax your muscles without slackening your back. I find it works best if I go in this order:

&gt;a. Focus on any spots that are particularly tight or that you have pre-existing pain and just imagine that muscle softening as you breath out. Like that relaxing your body does automatically when sighing.

&gt;b. Then focus from top to bottom. Relax the muscles of the head, around the eyes and foreheaed, the jaw and mouth, the neck, the shoulders, the arms. Then back to the core, focus on those tight and uncomfortable back muscles. If you can't relax them completely, move on to the pelvis and hips, then legs, then feet.

&gt;c. Circle back to the chest and belly area and just keep focusing on the back while breathing. 

4, Move on to more traditional breathing mediation where you do nothing but retain that posture and try to keep a clear mind by focusing on the in and out breath. You can adjust your posture as needed, if you feel yourself slacking or hunching, just take note of it, and fix it. Don't judge yourself over it, after about 5-10 minutes, the muscles will become accustomed to the position, and you might feel tension, but you shouldn't feel pain anymore.

While most meditation focuses on the breathing, I find picking an area of discomfort to focus on is actually more centering than the breath, and for me, it's my upper back due to slouching over a computer most days.

Why go through all the trouble? Because being able to stand upright, while relaxed, is a god-tier feeling. You feel more confident, you breath easier, for some reason your back feels less fragile if you suffer regular back pain. And you look better to others. 

There are plenty of articles out there about the importance of good posture. And there are a lot that recommend stretches and exercises that help. But this method works for me. And I generally feel physically and mentally better for hours afterwards (As a depression sufferer myself, I am NOT saying this is a cure/cure-all, but for me personally, my mind and the state of my body are heavily linked, and hey, what do you have to lose by trying it out?)

If allowed, I can post links to two guided meditations that I use when I first started or can't focus

LifeProTips,"TLDR: Hearing is an extremely crucial part in learning social skills; even if your child has only slight hearing loss you might want to get them hearing aids.

I've gone through life knowing that I was slightly hard of hearing but I only found out that I needed hearing aids at the age of 23. My parents were told that I should probably get them when I was younger but thought that I would never wear them, so they never got them. I am able to function without hearing aids but, having them now, I've realised what I missed.

Without the proper ability to hear, I wasn't able to join most conversations with classmates/friends and would spend most of them pretending to know what was being said and laughing when everyone else did. Without that social practice, I can't properly participate in conversations or effectively express my thoughts in words.

LifeProTips,"Often, air is very dry when it's cold. This means it is easier for water to evaporate into the dry air. What you should also know is that water evaporates at all times but the speed at which this happens differ depending on temperature and humidity. Higher humidity meanind lower evaporation and vice versa, and also a higher temperature gives a higher evaporation and vice versa. Now to why you get a sore throat. Your body is around 37C on the inside and every time you breathe out some water from your throat is evaporated and taken with the air, removing it from your throat. Normally this evaporation happens at a speed that your body can keep up with by 'refilling' the water that's lost. However when the air is really dry, like with cold weather, the evaporation happens at a faster speed and your body can't keep up. This results in your throat quite literally drying up and gives you the sore throat feeling. Also this process happens faster when you breath through your mouth, so to prevent this happening as much as possible try to breathe through your nose. As there is more resistance that way which will recapture some of those water vapors.

Here are some of the tactics gaslighters use to confuse and manipulate you!  


## 1. They Lie To You 

  
Gaslighters are habitual and pathological liars. They will tell bald-faced lies and then insist that they are telling the truth - despite all evidence to the contrary.   
You can’t convince them to admit to a lie. In fact, they will insist that any evidence you might offer, is itself a lie.   
They demonstrate such conviction in their lies, that they can cause you to second-guess objective truth.   
They will insist on “their truth” and can do so very persuasively. They can keep you feeling confused and off-balance.   
Even when they don’t fool you, you can be left with the impression that they are being perfectly sincere, albeit their position or perception is obviously wrong.   


## 2. They Undermine Your Reputation 

  
Gaslighters can identify people who will take their side, no matter what the issue may be.  
They then recruit these people to attack you by making up rumors that call your character - or even your sanity - into question. They may even state that they are concerned about you and suggest to others that your behavior is disturbing.  
This approach can be very effective. By initiating and then dominating the narrative, the gaslighter will gain allies while keeping them in the dark as to what is really going on.   
They may even tell you that other people think there is something wrong with you - while others might not be saying any such things at all.   
But unfortunately, a gaslighter can be very convincing and this can devastate your relationships with people.   


## 3. They Steer You Away From The Actual Topic

  
When you ask a gaslighter about something or try to nail them down for something they have said or done, don’t be surprised if they change the subject without addressing it.   
They will often either ask you a question to deflect you or accuse you of something.   
A gaslighter will typically react by claiming that they never said what you say they did. They will accuse you of remembering incorrectly or imagining things, or suggest that you got the idea from your “crazy” friends.

3. You get to bond with their parents, so you can go to them directly if kids can't resolve future issues themselves.

During the time I couldn’t breath, I kept thinking that any second now the person would realize that I didn’t answer and come running to help me. But they never came. The food dislodged on it’s own, thank God. 

If you are not actually concerned, it’s better that you don’t even ask. If the person had never asked, I might have thought about doing some drastic gesture to get their attention, like knocking something over, but I didn’t because I figured they were on notice that something was wrong. 

So by asking and not checking on someone if they don’t answer, you may have made it less likely that they will be ok. 

So don’t be a lazy mofo and go check. No excuses.","LPT: If you ask someone who is not in sight, “Are you ok?” and they don’t respond, IMMEDIATELY go check on them.

LifeProTips,"Helmets are absolutely essential if you are considering a high speed activity or something where your head takes an impact. A helmet protects your brain, and if your brain gets damaged, the rest of your body and consciousness doesn’t work correctly anymore. Don’t take that fact lightly.

Helmets are typically rated for a few minor impacts (like dropping on a table or couch or hitting a dashboard after sudden braking) and one major impact (impact on roll cage, roadslide, hitting a barrier on a freeway, falling off a bike for motorcycles and cars. Falling of a bike or falling off a skateboard and hitting the ground hard with non vehicular activities). Whatever the impact is, helmets should be taken care of and not neglected as a tool. 

Not every helmet you come across is safe. If the helmet is missing a safety label (SNELL certification for recreational helmets, SNELL/ECE/FIM for motorcycle, SNELL/FIA for car helmets, research for other specific activities), don’t buy the helmet. You have no way of verifying that the helmet is safe. Helmets standards in the US are incredibly low to the point where a cheap helmet can actually cause more harm than good. This is why you see people on harleys wearing little plastic buckets that say “DOT” on the back. They’re certified safe, but only according to a 1970’s standard. EU standards tend to be more reliable.

A helmet is only good for one person. That means no sharing, ever. The liner in a helmet starts to take shape of the user’s head, so when the helmet is worn in, it creates a line that will protect the intended user. That also means if someone else uses the helmet, there are gaps in the liner. In other words, on an impact the forces might not be dissipated sufficiently to prevent harm. This is the reason why you should bring your own helmet to places like go karting or motorcycle classes.

Helmet sizing matters. Take time to find the right size for a helmet, as the liner only protects for the intended head shape and size. Take note of your head shape and head size by measuring the crown of your head, and having someone tell you the shape of your head. A good helmet will be fit like a chipmunk and feel only slightly tight on the head. It should not be very tight, it should be teetering on tight and firm.

Helmet materials are important to note, the three most common are polycarbonate, fiberglass, and carbon fiber. Polycarbonate is heavy and thick plastic, and thrives at low speed impacts. Fiberglass is a material that dissipates impacts by breaking like glass, that way the kinetic forces are spread throughout the material. Fiberglass is as heavy as polycarbonate but is safer at high speeds. Carbon fiber is lightweight and has the same breaking qualities as fiberglass.

One last thing, the intended use of a helmet is important. A motorcycle helmet won’t protect in football, and vice versa. Substitute helmets don’t work. They are designed differently and will not protect the user sufficiently.

Some of you need to hear that you are also one of the people who needs to be treated like you treat other people. 

Some need to learn what it feels like to be treated in such a grace and mercy devoid manner, but more importantly, some of you need to come to an understanding that you deserve the same understanding and love that you show to others! 

Regardless of which one you are, the goal is the same, for us all to reach self awareness and drop the facades that keep us trapped in unhappiness. Forgiveness, grace, and mercy are the hallmarks of a person who is approaching self awareness. When you come to a true understanding that we are all imperfect, that we all fall short, that we will all disappoint others, and we will all disappoint ourselves; it becomes easier to extend grace. People desire to be heard, understood and loved. The behaviors that you find detestable in others and in yourself are cries to feel validation. Most of us do not understand why we and others do things but if you remember that our deep desires are love and validation it becomes possible to be compassionate to all.",LPT: Live by the Golden Rule.

LifeProTips,"Have you ever heard of The Four Temperament Theory? It's a proto-psychological theory that suggests that there are four fundamental personality types. 

These temperaments are believed to affect behavior - and learning more about them can help you predict patterns, not only in others but in yourself as well. 

Each of the four temperaments has been studied intensively, so we know all about their associated characteristics - including their strengths and weaknesses. Knowing the ‘ins and outs’ of the four temperaments can give you a better level of self-awareness. 

It can also help you better understand those around you. So, let’s learn more about them! 

## 1. The Sanguine 

This type is often described as spontaneous, optimistic, and energetic. As you might imagine, those who fall into the sanguine archetype are extroverts. 

With high energy levels and an insatiable curiosity, people with this temperament tend to love adventures and seek out new experiences. They can hold a conversation with almost anyone and bring their playful energy into their interactions. 

As natural entertainers, sanguine types love being the center of attention. They pride themselves on their individuality and enjoy displaying their differences. 

Another notable trait of this type is their ability to express and receive love and affection. However, these individuals are easily devastated if not constantly reassured that they are loved and appreciated. 

That said, they believe in forgiving and forgetting, and expect other people to feel the same way. A major downfall of the sanguine type is that they tend to be impulsive. 

Poor planning skills, disorganized thinking, and chaotic environments are the cost of living a life of spontaneity. 

## 2. The Choleric 

These people like to speak their mind with dominance and strength. Their source of power comes from their mental strength - which is evident through their knack for critical thinking and creative problem-solving. 

If you've ever met a choleric type, you would describe them as blunt, tough, or brave. Other qualities of this type include immense focus and strong competitiveness. You might assume they have something to prove - and they usually do. 

Choleric people excel in new environments and situations, so they actively seek them out. With rigid goals in mind, people with this temperament rarely stray away from their path to success. 

They know what they want and they keep going until they reach their goal - and nothing you say can change that. Fear is an unfamiliar concept to the choleric - at least, that's what they want you to think. 

They possess the highest self-esteem compared to the other temperaments, and confidence is their guiding light. These types are assertive and demanding. 

Sometimes, they let their emotions get the best of them and they react with intimidating intensity. People with the choleric temperament are known to get what they want when they want it.

LifeProTips,"Arguably the greatest obstacle for people wanting to make their lives better is the insurmountable mental block associated with getting a productive regimen started. Your brain tricks you into thinking that it's too hard, it takes too long, it's too much effort, etc. because the first few times you do it, it *is* and it *does*. 

Imagine that you don't know how to tie shoelaces; you're going to tell yourself it's not worth learning because it's too difficult, you'll never remember it, so on and so forth, so you handicap yourself and only wear velcro strap shoes which - let's be real here, sorry sneakerheads - limits your choices in comfort, fashion, so on and so forth. But that is almost inconceivable because the vast majority of us can tie our shoes in literally under five seconds. The truth is, this is exactly analogous to all kinds of things we could be doing in our lives to better our own situation. 

Cooking for yourself takes time and effort to learn, a gym routine takes time and effort to learn, etc. In your mind, you are imagining the massive undertaking of cooking some kind of five star multi-course meal, or running through the entire circuit of gym equipment and exercise routines. That's not what is expected of you - with preparation included, you can cook a tasty, healthy meal for yourself in 20 minutes if you make friends with a frying pan, and you can run through an entire gym routine in roughly the same amount of time if you structure it around a few key exercises. The issue is that the depressed, unmotivated part of your mind thinks that you are supposed to be utterly exhausted after doing these things, but you're not. They're actually supposed to feel more like afterthoughts, so that you are free to focus on things that make you happy - your significant other, your hobbies, whatever! 

Before they feel like that, though, they need an initial investment. Reserve a day to practice cooking a few different dishes. Take time to discover what kind of exercise your body needs and what it can tolerate. Formulate a routine, do it, do it again, make the routine leaner and leaner over time. Eventually, you won't even notice that you're doing it, and *that's the point!* Not only will you actually *be* more productive, you'll *feel* more productive, and those two things are two sides of the same coin.",LPT: The key to establishing a healthy/positive routine is learning to do things efficiently and quickly

In my mid to late 20s, I developed a general anxiety disorder that was substantial enough to affect my every day life. At its peak, I literally thought I was losing my mind, and couldn't figure out what was wrong with me.

I finally opened up to my mother about my struggles and she immediately said, ""oh, your father went through the exact same thing at your age, and his father did as well.""

That news should have been comforting, but in the moment it was infuriating. Here I am thinking that I've done something wrong to lead to this when it was apparently incredibly genetic. Knowing this before hand would have provided a great deal of insight into preparing for and dealing with the struggles to come.

LifeProTips,"One of my less mindful habits is that I’m sometimes a bit of a news junkie - I’d happily sit in front of the news channel or scrolling through twitter when a big story is happening. This can be bad for our wellbeing though, particularly as the algorithm that controls our news feed is designed to provoke a reaction from us. Emotions like fear and anger are a lot more likely to grab people’s attention than happiness, so the content that we get fed through tends to water the seeds of anxiety and resentment.   

We can notice how much time we’re depending on the news and social media and limit ourselves, setting a regular alarm on our phone (the Plum Village app is good for this). When it goes off, if you’re watching the news or on social media, just stop, breath, notice your thoughts, notice what you’re feeling. With more awareness, you can make informed decisions about the media you consume and decide for yourself when to stop. 

But the evidence shows that with the news and social media, less is more. You can get a summary of whats going on once or twice a day - with the time you save you can call up a friend, go for a walk, enjoy nature. Its critical to be aware of what you consume, not just through your mouth but through your eyes and ears as well. The seeds we water create the garden we live in.

Buy a VR headset.

It doesn't have to be an expensive one. Until my nice one arrives, I'm just using a $20 one from eBay that I slot my phone into, along with my regular headphones.

Go onto YouTube and search ""360 VR"" along with anywhere you want to go.

Honestly, this helped lift me out of my depression. Being able to look all the way around and walk down the streets of Osaka, surrounded by crowds of people without fear...it helps so much.

With these videos, I'm walking the canals in Venice again. I'm speeding along on a motorbike in Thailand. The New Years fireworks are bursting below me from the observation deck in Hong Kong.

Look up places you haven't been to yet. It's an awesome way of planning your future trips, getting to live them a little first. There are even VR tours of other planets.

I can't recommend it highly enough. It gives me back a feeling of normalcy, something I desperately need in times like this. It tides me over until the borders open and I don't have to be afraid of every tiny cough.

I hope it helps you too!",LPT: Feeling stuck in lockdown? Get a VR headset and tour any city you want.

Look at their faces and remember the areas they live, it could save you or one of your children one day.

In my case the offender moved into an apartment 3 blocks away from a public park. I looked up my state's laws and they were not allowed residence within 1000 feet of a public park or school. A quick measure on Google Maps showed he was 718 feet away. I submitted a semi-anonymous tip (email contact info only) on the registry map and a warrant was issued for his arrest.

In the email response a detective thanked me and told me sometimes they slip through the cracks because their probation officers don't know where parks or schools are compared to their addresses.

In general just always plan that you will need to pickup your kid when they’re out somewhere, you never know what might happen. They might find themselves in a dangerous situation. Even if they said they had a drive home they might not. Even if they went out without permission don’t put the situation in another parents hands to take them home or leave your kid in a possibly dangerous situation.

""but, But, BUT attractiveness is subjective!""

Yes, yes it is. Sort of. No, physical looks aren't everything. Yes, dating apps can be shallow. This is just a simple tip that I see ignored over and over on dating apps that I think would increase chances if implemented. It's not about tricking the viewer into thinking you are the most attractive person in the world, it's about first impressions. 

All the time I see guys in group photos on their first Tinder picture (which is another no-no) with other men who are conventionally more attractive than themselves. When you swipe to the next person to figure out whose profile you are actually looking at, you are already subconsciously (or actively) hoping that it is the most attractive one in that group. So when it is not, the first emotion established is disappointment. Obviously that's not the desired reaction, even if it is debatably shallow.

Most people are, by definition, average looking. This probably doesn't apply if you are like a 9.5 and your friend just happens to be a 9.75, but it's a thing for most normal looking dudes (and possibly women, idk that's not my wheelhouse).",LPT: Don't put people who are better looking than you in your dating app profile

One thing that i did, was distance myself from my thoughts and treat them as a different person talking to me. I was shocked to realise that they were exactly the same stuff that someone, who absolutely hates me and wants me to fail at everything, would say. Now i am trying to keep these thoughts down, not paying attention and improve. Same way that i stayed away from some people in my life because they were toxic. When it comes to inner thoughts tho, it is hard to act as easily, because it's us. Treating them like it's someone else makes it easier to silence them.

TLDR: Think of self-defeating thoughts as someone else's words and not your own. Then try to react to them in the same way you would irl if someone was as mean to you as that. Because they're not true.",LPT for those with self-defeating thoughts
LifeProTips,"I heard this a while back but for the life of me I can't find who originally said it.

My mum is the most stunning person in the world yet takes an awful photo. It can be pretty damaging to believe that a photo is a somewhat accurate representation of how you look. Photos are often distorted and only allow you to see a split second of your existence.

LifeProTips,"This obviously doesn't apply to people without kids but I wasnt sure where to post this. It's been weighing on me lately though. Dont let your kids get to the age of accountability without them having any idea how to navigate through this world. One day they will thank you when they see their peers that were raised without guidance and inevitably have to learn the hard way. This is when the light bulb goes off and they are grateful for the things they may have resented you for in the past. It's great if you and your kids get along and can have fun together but you are not their friend first. While its important to play on that part though, sometimes it's just as important to play what they will perceive as the enemy for lack of a better word (I'm bad at articulating what I mean sometimes). You wont be the ""cool"" parent and you will feel unappreciated many times over but the reward of being able to respect the adults that your children will grow into is immeasurable IMO. And ironically, this is usually the point that you actually do become friends with your children because you've done your job.",LPT: If you don't discipline your children then eventually someone else is going to get to decide how they are disciplined.

LifeProTips,"It's easier said than done, but how many times are we put down by the (perceived) opinion of others about ourselves? How many times are we felled by our own insecurities, our expectations of ourselves. How many times do we crank our neck to look up to ideals or goals that are unfair, unjust, unrealistic?

LifeProTips,"Making a list is the best way to procrastinate, and it's worthless on it's own. We imagine the list as a record of decisions we've generously made for our future selves, but that's just not how decisions work. A decision (the ""cutting off"" point) is necessarily made in the present moment, and can only be a response to your understanding of your current situation. So being productive is just getting good at orienting yourself to the current situation and responding intelligently, over and over again. 

The checklist is useful as distributed cognition, as a way to get things off your mind and onto paper so you can stop thinking about it now, and refer back to it later (when your ""situation"" is ""there's time to do some stuff""). Lists can't do the work of decisions and actions, so don't start your day with them.

That's why ""If You Want to Change the World, Start Off by Making Your Bed"" (Admiral William McRaven) is such good advice. It teaches a bias towards action that can easily cascade through the rest of the day.",LPT: Do something useful before you write your checklist

LifeProTips,"Really like this should be common sense obviously at this point, and heck if not then seriously it should be legislated, honestly. Especially in these days, considering the number of guys who willingly choose to take up the seats of the bus that better deserve to go to those who may be pregnant or who either identify themselves as being pregnant while riding public transit, selfishness among the opposite sex (particularly the more unthoughtful amongst the two) is undoubtedly at an all time high, and there is a lot that can (and should) be done within our society to address this issue.

Tdlr; if it's got balls, then give up that seat and park that mfk'n ass up against the walls! Someone more deserving should have a place to sit, and you won't have to stand it for longer than thirty to forty minutes at the very least.
