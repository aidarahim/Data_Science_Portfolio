Showerthoughts,"By that I mean the opposite of Anger is Hope and the opposite of Tranquility is Despair despite what one would normally assume. Seems pretty ridiculous at first but if you think about other opposition emotions, one is caused due to the absence of causes for the other.

You get sad when there’s nothing to make you happy.

You get bored when there’s nothing to make you interested.

You get scared when there’s nothing to make you feel safe.

So when do you get angry? When there’s nothing to calm you down? No, angry people often have more calming things they could be doing at the moment but focus on the rage instead. Similarly, you can be calm and experience events that would make you angry in another situation but feel fine because you’re calm.

Anger is the opposite of hope because you resort to anger when you have no hope left, it’s when you feel like there’s nothing you can do and anything you try will be useless, that you resort to rage, often trying to deal with your problems with violence or screaming and not through any productive means, since you’ve lost hope of finding a good way to sort out what’s bothering you.

And tranquility is the opposite of despair because one can stay calm only when they have no despair, no worry of things getting worse. If you have no reason to think that you’re situation is going to go to shit then you can stay calm even when bad things happen, because even if a bad thing has happened things in general are good.",Anger/tranquility and hope/despair aren’t opposites
