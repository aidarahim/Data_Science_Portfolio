LifeProTips,"I've seen this many times. Using an analogy is a great way to phrase an issue in a familiar way, or link to an existing concept. If you're talking with someone who *really* wants to learn, analogies are a great tool.

*However*, if you're debating someone with an opposing view who is more closed-minded, analogies will backfire because your opponent will immediately point out the differences between the two situations. (And of course there will be differences, because no situations are ever exactly alike.)  The debate will then devolve into exactly why and how the situations are different, and whether the differences are material.

Example #1: I'm a software developer and I had an old boss who was hard-headed. He wanted to rewrite tens of thousands of lines of C# code into Objective-C because that's what all the cool kids were doing. I tried to explain that programming languages are sort of like spoken languages - none is ""better"" than the other, and it's best to stick with what you're competent in. This devolved into a shouting match about how programming languages differ from spoken languages.

Example #2: Many of the analogies used with COVID-19 masks, such as the [Urine Test](https://www.newsweek.com/urine-test-helps-explain-importance-wearing-maskshumorously-1515728), while instructive, are swiped away by non-believers who list the ways in which this is different than respiratory particles.

Example #3: On 9/11, as many on twitter posted about the lives and buildings destroyed on that day, #allbuildingsmatter trended on twitter as an analogy to highlight the issues with the phrase ""All Lives Matter"". I thought it was a good analogy, and helpful in its simplicity. Many conservative posters immediately responded by pointing out that lives are different than buildings, and other ways in which the two scenarios were different.

This is a highly effective tactic because analogies are never perfect matches with a situation (nor are they intended to be). By pointing out differences, no matter how immaterial, the metaphor is lost and the conversation veers off-course.

Don't think that you can bypass this by coming up with a PERFECT analogy. There will always be differences.

Example #4: In the political wake of RBG's death last night, Mitch McConnell and Trump have already declared their intention to bring a new Supreme Court candidate for a Senate vote, even right before the election. The obvious analogy is 2016 when McConnell blocked Obama's nominee for many months ostensibly because a president shouldn't be able to appoint a Supreme Court candidate during an election year.

Even though this appears to be an exactly perfectly matched situation, there are small differences which the Republicans are seizing upon to declare that ""this is different."" Never underestimate this ability!

If you know you're debating someone extremely stubborn, skip the analogies.","LPT: When debating, analogies work well with neutral/open-minded people, but they will backfire with opposing or hard-headed adversaries."

LifeProTips,"When life hits you hard, where do you go to find fault? Do you blame the outside world for the ills it continues to heap on your life? Or, do you think about what you could have done to avoid such mishaps? If you sound like the former, you’ve likely got an external locus of control. If you believe strongly in personal responsibility, it means you tend toward an internal locus.

Your locus of control says a lot about how you view the world and your role in determining the course of your life.

I share my experience with the locus rule here: [https://youtu.be/gi88EBP-dW0](https://youtu.be/gi88EBP-dW0)

Individuals with an internal locus of control are self-motivated and focused on achieving the goals they have set for themselves. For these reasons, people with a strong internal locus of control often make good leaders.

If you have an external locus of control, you likely believe that what happens to you is the result of luck or fate, or is determined by people in authority. You may tend to give up when life doesn’t “go your way,” because you don’t feel that you have the power to change it.

It’s important to know that there are some downsides to having a strong internal locus of control. 

A powerful self-belief may lead you to believe that you can control everything, so you may want to be careful to avoid seeming arrogant or “walking over” other people in pursuit of your objectives.

LifeProTips,"Before I start two caveats:
 
 A) This only applies to white collar companies that are large enough to have a robust HR department 
 
B) This is meant to be a conceptual framework, there’s A LOT of variance of what I’m about to post, but your actual system should rhyme.
 
——-
 
I see a lot of posts on here that boil down to “you should change jobs every 2-3 years”, “always keep your resume updated”, and “your employee won’t be loyal to you, so don’t be loyal to them”
 
This advice is largely good advice but I think these posts usually miss two things: details of how companies value employee and why they value them as such.
 
Companies really view employees in several buckets, and how they treat employees will vary wildly depending on which bucket you are in.
 
Bucket 1: Top 5-10% of employees. These are the people viewed as future leaders of the organization. Usually, they have the support of a senior exec(s). They get accelerated promotions, and their raises always keep them at the top of the market. There’s probably secret or not so secret lists of who these people are. They are often shuffled around a variety of different positions so they can get the experience to be a senior leader some day.
 
Bucket 2: The next 20-25% or so. The high performers. They get promoted on schedule. These people get high enough raises and bonuses that most will stay. They usually have an easy time with job mobility, and the company will be flexible with them (E.g., they need to WFH more because of kids, or they want to work remotely from a satellite office in another city).
 
Together Bucket 1 and Bucket two are the only people the firm actively wants to keep. They will almost never get laid off – even if their entire division is eliminated, the companies will find positions for people elsewhere. They will still get good raises and bonuses even in recessions. They get assigned to the cool project, and the firm actively tries to develop them. Also note, these positions are not equally distributed. A LOT less people are bucket 1 / bucket 2 equivalent if you’re in like back office, support, call centers, etc…the reason being they don’t need that many future leaders, and people are more replacement
 
Bucket 3: the next 60-70%. This is where most people find themselves. At this level, companies actually DON’T want to keep everyone. They want to keep enough that it doesn’t mess up business continuity, but they actually want some attrition. They need a constantly pipeline of young talent, and “Average” people take up a spot. Companies do not want too many people who has been an analyst for 10 years without a promotion. Because of this, you give mediocre raises and bonuses, you give enough that enough of them stay, but you actually price it in such a way that some people leave. Who cares if you need to pay 10-20% more to replace the person who left: 1) that person that replaces them may be a bucket one or two 2) a majority of bucket three people wont leave even if you give shitty raises, so on aggregate its cheaper than giving everybody big raises every years
 

Bucket 4: The bottom 5-10%. These are people you put on PIPS, fire, or “put out to pasture” in shitty roles into they quit. This one is self-explanatory. Try to avoid being in the bucket. But, note, there’s little incentive to being a high performing 3 (40th percentile) versus a low performing 3 (80th percentile). If you are not going to be a top performer, you should just work hard enough to avoid being a bucket 4.

In conclusion, you should either aim to be a top 1/3 performer (bucket 1 or 2), or you should switch jobs are 2-3 years. Companies are not being stupid when they give you low raises and promotions, they are acting rational. On the other hand, If you a top performer, it may be worthwhile to stay at the company, since network is important and you can be put on an accelerated path.",LPT: Understand how employees rank and view employees

**Daylight is the most dominant factor regulating our biological clock.** This means that exposure to the right amount of natural light during the day, and less exposure to artificial light at night can have a positive effect on our sleep/wake cycle.  greater access to daylight can improve productivity by as much as **20%**, as well as enhancing satisfaction in the workplace.

To become the best basketball player, you need to improve your basketball skills.

See a repetitive pattern?

To become the best \[PROFESSION\], you need to improve \[PROFESSION SKILLS\]

A simple formula for how to become the best in the world in anything you do. No secrets. No magic pills. Just applying it, you can be the top 1.

But here’s a little thing…

Even knowing this formula, only 0.0001% of you will achieve such high results. Why? Because you haven’t paid attention to \**one word*\* in this formula — word IMPROVE.

How far we can go in some field determined by the way we improve our skills. If someone improves by 1% in a year and another by 1000%, it will make a huge difference. So if you know how to improve your skills most effectively, you will be the best in anything you do.

And Michael Jordan knows how.

Through Deliberate Practice.

Most people do “normal practice”. For example, if someone wants to be the best basketball player, he thinks, “I need to train hard”.

But you never be the best one even if you “train hard”. You need to do more.

**And this is the difference between most people and Michael Jordan. He does Deliberate Practice instead of Normal.**

What’s the difference?

To do a deliberate practice you need these things:

1. Teacher (provides practice activities designed to help you improve performance)
2. Perform at maximum effort (constantly being taken out of your comfort zone)
3. Well defined and specific goals (not just “overall improvement”)
4. To be in focus (give your full attention, no distractions)
5. Do conscious actions (no autopilot)
6. Instant response to feedback and modifying your strategy

If you’re in a field where deliberate practice is not an option, apply the principles as much as possible, and you will improve your skills tremendously.

Many of us think that we need a natural talent or be prodigies to be the best at what we do. But the truth is you can be the best one in anything you do if you know how to practice right.

LifeProTips,"I was 18 when I bought my first car. I hated going to dealerships so I used an alternative site to purchase the vehicle. I had it in my mind that now that I was an adult legally I could buy it by myself with no help. Pro tip 1: if you have a question, ask it. There were multiple things I didn’t fully understand and just accepted. I bought the vehicle at a 18.9% interest rate. Even though I KNEW the rate sounded high I still accepted it and stopped paying attention and just made my payments. When I realized I was paid a lot on the vehicle and wasn’t making a dent on my principal loan is when I finally realized my mistake. I’ve since gotten it refinanced at 4.7% which is a HUGE decrease. The guy even said he felt like he needed to help me get my rate down because the original loan was so bad.

I was so fed up with this that I thought of a solution. On the day that I get my salary, I have a returning automatic transfer of my full salary set up to a second savings account. This happens every four weeks. I have hidden this savings account from view in the bank app to avoid accidental spending.

Anyway
 

I bought a ps4 and the controller stopped working on bluetooth after 9 months. I don't need to return everything just the controller, but they came as a bundle and I know this gets messy on till systems. They will want the whole order, games console and handset as a bundle like I bought it.

So I called customer service to check a partial exchange is possible (it is)

Then I called the retailer that runs out of my local supermarket, to ask about a return. The cashier says no but I informed him customer service says it's possible. The cashier checks with their manager and calls me back about an hour later saying it's all good.

This saved me waiting in store all that time and being a karen, and also saved the cashier not knowing and being an awkward barrier to an obvious easy solution.

I know from working in retail that leaving the customer in the dark is a shitty feeling. They they can whinge to other customers and hurt sales and staff commission.

 Instead I rock up knowing I'm good, the cashier also knows the score so we don't have to bitch and no one else needs to que, it was truly easy.

I don't wanna talk for him but he seemed really pleased knowing he knew what was up and how to do it without any faf and it felt 'nice' if that makes sense.

I know retail staff are being hammered cause of corona so make it easy for them where you can 😊

Slightly less short version: I'm a broke, recently graduated nontraditional American college student.  I was as sick as I've ever been in my life back in February, but since there were ""no cases"" of Covid-19 in my town at the time, I thought it was just a bad flu.  A few months later, I read a few people's accounts of ""mild"" cases of Covid, and what they described fit my experience perfectly.    


I wanted to get tested to know for sure, but I don't have health insurance, so I didn't want to get tested and then face a potentially large bill.  I donated blood today, and was pleasantly surprised when they told me everyone's blood would be tested for Covid antibodies, and if it was negative: they wouldn't contact me, but if it was positive: they would let me know.    


So you can donate much needed blood *and* find out if you've had Covid or not.  Even if you haven't had symptoms, since you can be an asymptomatic carrier, it's useful to know.

Hey guys,


This is prob going to be a really random post but here it goes. 

So for a very long time, I was pretty chubby and Was not a fan of my body at all. So for a very long time, I would do this thing where I would delicately stick out my stomach in a way to see how big or fat’ my stomach was.  I would stick it out in the same way, a young person would stick out their stomach when they are trying to pretend they are pregnant. 

I have been doing this for years and it’s only now I have realised that, it isn’t exactly good for my self esteem or my back particularly. Anyways, I am now trying to stop sticking out my stomach but it’s like because I used to it allllll the time, even when I think I’m not doing it, I find out I am slightly kinda doing it or even sometimes just tensing the stomach.

Anyone got any tips on what I could do to just stop doing both completely?

Many thanks!",LPT: How to stop sticking stomach out

LifeProTips,"My wife's car (our only car at the moment since she's the only one working) had several issues that were beginning to add up; Service Air Bag, radio randomly shut off and on, back up assist chime would be super quiet, passenger side power window would roll down but not up, dome light would not light up when doors were open. Decided to take the car for a couple of days and see about fixing the issues myself since I'm unemployed.

I literally found every single issue (and solution) via Google and YouTube.

The service air bag? Loose harness under the seat.

Radio shutting off randomly? The harness had a frayed wire that had been repaired (poorly) previously. I skipped it, put a proper butt splicer on it, and works fine now.

Back up assist chime? Apparently it was connected to the bass of the driver side speaker and the speaker wire was loose. Again, simple fix.

Passenger side window? The switch was busted. Replaced for about $10 that I bought from a local shop directly (not a dealership shop).

Dome light not coming on? My wife forgot she shut it off and forgot to turn it back on.

For each of these, I was able to go through YouTube to find out: 1. What the issue may be, 2. Diagnose, 3. How to get to the part in particular, 4. Replacing / Repairing, 5. Reassemble.

Most of the time these alerts on your dash can be fixed by simply looking up the issue. Sure, if you have a check engine light on and you hear a loud, repetitive knocking? Maybe that would be a good time to take it to the shop. But is it a minor issue? Fix it yourself!

Shops will charge you to look into it / diagnose it, labor, parts (usually @150% or more), and then whatever else they feel like charging.

You'll save so much more money at least *trying* to figure out the issue yourself. If you feel like you're getting in over your head, stop and get professional help.","LPT: Before you take your car to the shop for (non - emergency) issues (e.g. Radio / Speaker issues, backup assist issues, some ""check x"" alerts), look up the issues on Google and YouTube.

You don’t have to make a mobile order (unless the coupon requires it) because I know how janky some of these mobile orders can be.

But before you get in the line to order food, take a quick check over at the mobile app to see if they have any deals you’d like. It can save you money on spending $6 or more for a meal, and you also might just find something else you want to eat.

For example, Burger king in the USA has an app deal that gives you a Cheeseburger, Medium fries, 10pc Nuggets, and a small drink for $3. McDonalds also has a deal on Fridays that give you a free medium fry for whatever you order.

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve pulled up to the speaker and saw the guy in front of me ordering $15 or more worth of items when I know he could’ve shaved off $4-$5 with the app. Personally I use it to get a BOGO free happy meal for my little siblings after work.

LifeProTips,"A few reasons to consider why the PS5 with the disc drive is a better investment.

-You can purchase games and resell them back to places like GameStop, or on Craigslist, eBay etc. If you recoup even 20% of a game at 70 dollars, you would only have to do that 7 times over the lifespan of the console to earn that hundred back. Odds are you'll get 40-60% back on new releases if you can complete them quickly.

-Stores like GameStop, Wal-Mart, and Best Buy will generally release games at 9pm vs the ps store forcing you to wait until midnight. That means you'd get a few hours extra to play games you're dying to get. (FF16?  God of War?!)

-it's also no secret that playing movies off of a disc will always have a better, more clear picture than it's streamed counterpart. It's not the end of the world type of difference, but hey.

&gt;A constant stream of sensational or ""disaster"" reporting, whether you are exposed actively or passively, can elevate stress levels and trigger symptoms like anxiety and trouble sleeping.

Over the long term, this anxiety can affect mood, which could lead to feelings of depression.


**Instead of consuming news all day, think about some constructive ways to spend the time. Hughes offers these ideas** :

#1 
Take advantage of technology and connect with loved ones virtually.

#2
Start a hobby.

#3
Deep-clean the house or garage.

#4
Get caught up on work tasks that have piled up.

#5
Get out of the house and exercise as much as you can to help release any of that pent-up anxiety.

#6
Start a mindfulness or meditation practice.

LifeProTips,"**Couple of scenarios**

1. A new homeowner who buys a fixer upper is an excellent scenario of a person who could easily be on either side of the fence when determining if the problems created by the solution, buying a fixer upper, outweighs the original problem being solved, which could be to increase the amount of house that could be bought while decreasing the amount of money required up front. 

Now, its easy to imagine how this scenario could be a solution that created a new set of problems that do not outweigh the original problem of cutting costs, as a fixer upper can easily get into the 10s to 100s of thousands of dollars in updates, upgrades, maintenance, and repairs. 

But with a little bit of forethought, a few hundred dollars for a home inspector, some careful research, and some shrewd haggling up front can put you in a home that not only reduces the potential of creating new problems, such as insane surprise or hidden costs, that outweigh the ones that originally were trying to solve, such as saving money on a home purchase, so it is worth thinking about not only the solutions, but the new problems being created as well, because it can help refine the solution before it is implemented. 

2. Smokers are good example of people with a problem that has a solution that clearly outweighs the new problems created by quitting 

Quitting smoking creates withdrawals and the symptoms that accompany it such as irritability and weight gain, but the overall benefit to tge body far outweighs


**Disclaimer: Don't overanalyze what every new problem caused by the solution that you choose could be, your progress and growth depend on risk and change**","LPT Often, a solution for a problem will create new problems.

 Answer their questions with nods or shake of the head. This will show you respect them but are concerned. Don't make alot of faces and never smile or laugh. Try to keep answers if spoken to yes or no. Answering a question with a question of your own will spiral into a heated argument.

 When people are angry they aren't thinking clearly. If your girlfriend saw you like another girls photo if you start defending it, she'll think you're hiding something. Ask why she is concerned and then LISTEN. Don't listen to respond, listen to understand.

No joke - over 15 hours was spent on the phone in a 2-3 year time period. (I live with a few gamers, so I know the issues were on Comcast, not us). The internet would CONSTANTLY shut off, requiring modem restarts 5-6 times a day, complete outages with no option for refund, erroneous charges up to $400 (for just internet, not even cable or anything fancy), we went through 4 different modems - each time a struggle just to get it set up, and just incredibly rude customer support the whole way though. Oh and they most certainly 'cap' your speed. 

I spent ~10 minutes speaking with CenturyLink. They installed what they needed, and no one has had a single issue in our house since. The speed is wildly improved, no disconnections.

LifeProTips,"I know this is counterintuitive. But rebuilding only to see it all burn down again in just a few years seems like a short term fix to a long-term inescapable problem of how climate change (recent droughts that lasted for 5-6 years) is increasing the size of forest fire prone areas. In fact after the fires in 2017, home insurance companies tried to stop insuring homes in forest-fire prone areas, and the governor of California stopped them but has not implemented a long term goal on how to expand affordable housing and move communities out of forest-fire prone areas. 

Unless one is extremely wealthy and is ok with rebuilding their homes every 2-4 years, it is not a good idea in the long term to be building in forest fire prone areas. But suppose you cannot at any cost escape being in that area, then if you must rebuild, then splurge on safety measures against forest fires. When people are in a hurry to rebuild and lack the funds to invest into less flammable construction materials and far more fire safety measures after the fires from 2017, the state governments did not see it politically advantageous to impose additional burdens of implementing and requiring homes to be built far more fire-resistant.

The hard truth is if you want to have a financially stable life and your home burned down in recent wildfires, you will not find it in the area where homes burned down.

If the government cared more about than staying in power and popular, there would a large investments in subsidizing the moving of communities and people from forest fire prone areas to less forest fire prone areas.

LifeProTips,"Just to head this off, I dont want this to completely dissuade anyone from giving their children a meaningful name. This is just something to think about when naming twins in general.

When you are having twins, it seems to be very tempting for people to give them both very similar names. Sometimes only having a one letter difference, or even the same name but spelled differently. I just am writing this to give pause to anyone thinking of doing this. I work in health insurance and all too often I see twins having their insurance messed up due to them having very, very similar names. If you think about it, to a computer system the twin's names are really the only difference between them. And when a human element is involved such as a data analyst or an insurance company employee, the two kids are bound to get mixed up. They have the same date of birth, the same last name, same age, in most cases same sex, same parents, which means in insurance, the primary policy holder has the same personal information as well for both kids. It's just a nightmare. If you throw in similar names, for example Tim and Jim, this just becomes a tangled web of them getting confused for each other. And if insurance gets messed up like this, I'm sure other aspects of life will as well.

I cant speak to any sort of identity issues that a kid may have down the line due to having another person identical to them in almost every way including name, but I feel like this will most likely be a factor for these children as well.

Sorry if this is coming off as rambling, but it's just something I see a lot and wanted to I form anyone who might be having twins that this is an issue that will come up and will probably persist throughout their whole lives.

LifeProTips,"Taking a few minutes a few times a day to stop and purposefully take a break from your thoughts and just allow yourself to visualize or do something using your heart instead of your head can help you feel a small amount of much needed joy and beauty or help you remember something that you may not have thought about in years or decades. Inspiration can deepen and you can find energy where mental and physical exhaustion usually live as you navigate your daily life on or off autopilot.

The mind and the heart can cooperate with each other to such a degree that they feel as if they have merged completely, giving you a sense of well being and oneness, but many times we pit our minds against our hearts for so long that they feel like enemies. The heart wants things that I can't have or do, we tell ourselves, but friend it doesn't have to be that way. 

We can bring our mind and heart into conscious cooperation, it just takes some practice thinking with your heart to remember what you instinctively already know, that life has the potential to be so beautiful and you can be happier than you are, no matter where you are or what you are doing.

I know it can sound like new age or spiritual wishful thinking, but if you give yourself a chance, try building the trust and cooperation between your mind and your heart, and you can find that life is something worthy and beautiful.","LPT Take some time each day to purposefully think, work, plan, write, or conversate with your heart and not your mind."
