LifeProTips,"I had a phone interview scheduled this morning, but accidentally slept through it. When I got up and saw that I missed it, I had the desperate urge to call and offer up excuses, in the hope that maybe, just maybe, they'd be understanding and give me another chance. 

Instead, all I did was apologize and ask if we could reschedule. That's it, one sentence, no additional information, no explanation or excuse as to why I missed the first interview. 

They replied within 20 minutes, apologizing to ME, saying it was probably their fault, that they'd been having trouble with their computer system for days, and of course I could reschedule, was I available that afternoon?

LifeProTips,"Assuming you have a good relationship with the guests, or you are family, and it's not unusual to hug people where you are.

When parents aren't controlling their children in your house, you can always ground them or take a toy away (the toy doesn't have to be with them).

But if you're not comfortable with that, hug them while they're standing on the floor facing the same direction as you are and peacefully tell them what they are doing wrong, keep hugging them until you feel like they understood. Do that in front of everyone and make sure they can hear what you're saying. You can be as lovable as you want. If they kick or bite you, don't brush that off, say that hurts, but don't release them. Release them when you feel like they understood. You can do that multiple times. 

This is NOT a parenting tip, your hug will be punishment. Don't worry, the child won't start disliking hugs from the parents, only yours.

And don't do that with a child that's stronger than you.

Remember, parents are always the guilty, not the child, who is craving for their parents attention.


I hope this prepares you for a situation like this. This is for desperate people who aren't comfortable punishing other people's children. If you don't feel the need to do this, do your thing, it's better.","LPT: if a guest's child is being uncontrollable, hug them"

LifeProTips,"When I get the cold, it's usually coughing, or the sniffles. My tip is for the second kind. With this type you have a runny nose, itchy eyes, and sometimes headaches. 

First of all, it's good to realize that the itching and sneezing are not directly caused by the virus itself, but because the way your immune system reacts. Because of this, anything that serves to strengthen the immune system of otherwise healthy people doesn't work at all. You could say that your immune system kinda overreacting got you into that shit. So all that vitamin c against the cold? It's kinda bogus. 

But there are medications made for the exact scenario ( your immune system throwing a tantrum which makes you sneeze and your eyes water): anti-hayfever medication! Most over the counter stuff helps to supress the strong reaction (the anti histamine stuff). 

A few sidenotes: some of these medicines aren't 100% safe to use when you're going to drive a car. Check tje labels. 

Also: it doesn't always work for everyone. It works for me, but I've read it can vary for person to medication to common cold type. However, still worth a try.",LPT: Anti hayfever meds can really help against the common cold.

LifeProTips,"Fruits are high in vitamins, and therefore completely eliminating them from your diet isn't something I'd recommend. But if weight loss is your goal, think twice before downing that all natural strawberry banana smoothie. Natural sugars and carbs are necessary for your health, but too much intake is both bad and very easy to achieve. 

For example: an average large banana has a whopping **27.3** grams of carbs. Factor in about 5-7 strawberries and now you're close to 35 grams of carbs. If this is the only fruit you take in for the day, not bad! But let's say you add an extra banana at lunch. Add in a couple of extra strawberries because it's just fruit, right? Maybe a pear or something. 

The point is, you are significantly overloading on sugar and carbohydrates with excessive fruit intake. This will inhibit your weight loss significantly. 

Instead of fruit, try more vegetables, which are significantly lower in both carbs and sugar yet still high in their various vitamin profiles. Couple that with complex carbohydrates and a **high protein diet** for the best results. Your plate should be majority protein every time you eat if weight loss is the goal, with maybe a small piece of fruit as dessert.","LPT: Fruits are not very conducive to weight loss.

LifeProTips,"We’ve all passed up on at least one purchase in fear of the dreaded auto billing. 

Maybe it was a trial for a free month of Hulu just because you wanted to binge watch Rick and Morty for free. Maybe it was a free week of some meal kit service, because not having to decide on dinner for a couple days is a WIN. 

HERE’S THE SOLUTION. 

Get a debit card/ money card that doesn’t have direct access to your primary bank account. 
i.e CashApp, Venmo. These accounts are funded only when you initiate the transfer. Both can be locked and unlocked with the click of a button. 
OR open an online banking account, it’s quick and easy (some even have infinitives to do so).

LifeProTips,"Whenever facing a job interview as an intern (or for any job interview really) the likelihood of you getting asked that question is quite high and the easiest and most truthful answer to that question for us aspiring interns is ""lack of experience"".

This has two advantages, firstly you don't have to panic about whether you should be truthful and go for a weakness that may lessen your chances and reveal an ungainly side of you and secondly, you're not giving anything away they don't already know, you're being truthful since it is your biggest weakness and the fact that they invited you to the interview means that they've already accepted that part of you so you have nothing to lose by giving that answer.

I am well aware that this is nothing new under the sun but since now's the season when all students should be sending out their applications for their summer internships I hope this will prove useful for everyone who wasn't aware of this tip yet, it helped me get through my interview and get the internship at my choice of hotel.

LifeProTips,"Thankfully a friend shared this with me before my dad passed away. When you lose someone, sometimes all you want is to hear them again, or see them smile, or look into their eyes. Thanks to our modern technology, we can get close.

Recordings won't ever be enough, but I can say from experience, they're far better than nothing. We recorded my Dad saying ""I love you"", something so simple, but it helped us get through the worst if it. 

My tip to you: take pictures, record video, record audio. Get both candid and purposeful content. We are lucky enough to live in a world that not only has the technology to do this any day we want, but has so many ways to store and share it when we need to. 

I lost a friend unexpectedly to cancer a little over a year ago, but I had known him through Twitch. To this day, I can still log in and watch some of the moments we shared in his streams, watch him alive and happy and having fun. It's been such a blessing to be able to do that, to know I'll never have to forget what he looks like or how he sounded.

I really suggest you try that kind of thing out. Make a stupid YouTube video with family. Host a podcast about your favorite hobby. Just record (with permission) a video call between you and your grandma. Anything. Believe me, when the day comes that you need it, you'll be glad you have a piece of them available, and if the reverse happens, they'll be so glad to have a piece of you.","LPT: get recordings of your loved ones, and have some of you"

LifeProTips,"So i just got off work, in the parking lot, there was this fucking idiot trying to force his way in the row, RIGHT before me, even though i didn't have enough space or time to let him pass. He stood still with his lights on and then suddenly dashed forward, almost hitting my car, he then had the audacity to honk at me, so i looked at him and honked back, gesturing wtf is wrong with this guy. He then managed to force himself behind me in the row and kept honking agressively. I ignored it thinking he would stop, but i looked at his license plate, just in case. I soon realized he started to follow me, flashing his lights in my face, jumping in front of me and brake checking me, trying to get me to pull over, which i ignored as well.

This guy kept following me and honking at me (mind you, this was about 10 minutes long) so eventually i snapped, parked my car on the side of the road and got out, walked towards the guy and started yelling at him as he was yelling back, told him wtf his problem was, that he had no right of way etc.. we insulted each other and then he tried to intimidate me by opening his door, which he noticed didn't phase me at all so he immediately shut it back. Then he said 'i got your license plate, we will see tomorrow dumbass' and sped off in the opposite direction (the direction we came from) which meant he purposefully followed me even if it meant going the wrong way.

Now i keep thinking 'what is gonna happen tomorrow, who will they believe? Will i get fired for this?' Like, what if this guy was someone with authority at my job? So now i should be asleep, but instead im sitting here wondering if this shit will get me in trouble/fired and how i can make them believe what actually happened.

So how do you keep peace of mind, stop worrying etc...?

LifeProTips,"If you celebrate any winter holiday that involves a TON of gift giving, this tip could help keep all that stress organized.
A little backstory: I noticed I would miss important people or be stuck last minute scrambling for a gift because I had no idea what to get them. Then a brilliant idea hit me: I could organize it in the notes app on my phone!! Bonus points if it’s on a cloud so you can access it on your mobile and computer easily.
Here’s how I do it: I make a note in my phone, and if needed, disguise it however necessary in case someone you know could see it. Then type in all the names of the people you want to get gifts this year and a colon. Brainstorm gift ideas for specific people and write them there, or when a great gift idea hits you, jot it in real quick before you forget.
Here’s where it gets really good. Use emojis to code the progress of each gift. If you have a few possible items in your cart on amazon, put a cart emoji next to those gifts listed in your notes app. If you have a few gifts for the same person, put a box emoji next to each one as they arrive so you know what you have and what you need. Once they’re wrapped, put a gift bag emoji. And so on and so on. Once a person’s gift(s) is all done, put a green check emoji in front of their name to signify that. Then you’ll know exactly how your gift giving is coming along with just a quick glance!
I’m posting this in February so you make the list now and have all year to think of everyone/everything. Lol.

I've watched a family drain their life savings trying to stop organ failure in their 90# dog who had gotten ahold of ONE GRAPE. They were unsuccessful. 

It's not worth it. There are plenty of safe animal food and treats you can give Fluffy instead of tossing him something off of your plate because he looks so pitiful begging.

Officers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength. Soldiers in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm."" If you burn your bridges, and remove the option of failure, you will succeed merely because you HAVE to, this ensures you give everything you could possibly give.

HN post:

Hi everyone,

It's Harry, Ethan, and Omid here from Motion ([https://inmotion.app](https://inmotion.app/)). We built a Chrome extension that uses real-time interventions to prevent people from unknowingly wasting time on online distractions.

A few months ago, I mentioned that I was spending too much time on Facebook. Omid recommended a browser extension to block certain sites. It worked well - my time wasted dropped to 15 minutes the next day. However, a few days later, I was setting up my company’s Facebook page, and the extension blocked me at the 15-min mark, the time I set for myself. I needed to finish that page, but there was no way around the hard-block, so I had to uninstall the extension.

Later, I tried other similar extensions. Each was either so permissive that it wasn't useful for my purpose, or so strict that I had to uninstall it. We realized that existing solutions did not work because their approach is too prescriptive and simplistic. They didn’t recognize that people also need to use Facebook, Youtube, etc. for legitimate purposes. The problem is really intricate. On one hand, Facebook is great for getting reminders on friends’ birthdays or managing business pages; on the other hand, every minute spent on Facebook could potentially lead to a trap. These traps come in all forms - video autoplay, news articles with catchy titles, and sponsored content that looks just like your friends’ posts. Instead of always being hindered from visiting these sites, I needed to have access to their useful parts, but be careful to not get distracted in the process.

I decided to build a simple tool for myself - a countdown timer each time I visit a distracting site. We all started using it and liked it, so we decided to hand out the extension to some friends. Surprisingly, despite many bugs, our user retention was infinitely higher than our previous ideas. In fact, we built 6 MVPs during our pivoting process - commission-free prediction market, recruiting platform for quant traders, intercity carpooling service, workplace motivation app, online travel agency, and crypto options market making (last one because both Ethan and I were options traders before our startup; Omid was a college student until this year. For backstory - Ethan and I were best friends in college, and Omid and I have been friends since high school) Since none of these ideas had worked and we were finally getting some users, we decided to work on this one. Also, with this one we were solving a problem that we ourselves had.

Here’s how it works now: each time you visit a distracting site (e.g. Twitter), we show a screen where you can choose to either leave or proceed to the site with a visible countdown timer. On sites like Facebook and Youtube, you can choose to hide the newsfeed or video recommendations. Once time is up, we ask you whether you're done. When you visit less distracting sites such as Gmail, you get reminders on how long you’ve been on these sites, so you don't unknowingly spend too long on things like responding to email.

Before you start working on something, you can write down your task, and it will show up with a timer on every tab you visit until you clear the task, so you don't get sidetracked. Finally, every morning, we give you a report on how you spent your time the previous day, and allow you to mark the sites that are distracting.

We firmly believe in data privacy, and promise that we will never sell user data. We do not collect the URL or content of sites you visit. We had to decide between using Chrome's ""all\_urls"" permission and the more narrow ""activeTab"" permission. If we only had activeTab, each time the user opens a new page they would have to manually activate our extension. That would be an unacceptable user experience in our opinion, so we settled on the broader permission.

The extension is free at the moment. We plan on releasing for other browsers in the upcoming weeks. We plan on monetizing either through a premium tier with productivity tools built for power users or charging a very low amount from every user.

Big tech companies have been attacking our attention with sophisticated technology, spending billions of dollars to optimize their engagement metrics. We may think we are in control, but often we are unknowingly being exploited by companies who profit handsomely off our attention—which, if you think about it, is the most valuable asset we have. If we could just simply turn off all these products, that would be an effective defense, but for many people that's not an option, so something more is required.

It's far from complete, but we believe we're on the road to building a more useful tool to help individuals defend their attention against these traps. This is a problem many in the HN community have thought a lot about. We’d really love your feedback and learn what you would like to see in a tool like this - what productivity problem do you have that a tool could help solve? How can tooling help to give us back control over our own attention? Thanks so much in advance!

Ready?  

Last Christmas, I gave my grandfather 2 smart bulbs and told him that these bulbs are very convenient to use because they can be controlled by voice. A few days ago, I went to see my grandparents and I discovered something. I spent the night at their home and early in the morning, I noticed that the lamps in the living room kept changing colors in a specific sequence: blue, pink, yellow. blue, pink, yellow…

The bulb was set to automatically turn itself on in the mornings and in the evenings. I was very confused by this and asked my grandfather about it. He smiled and told me to ask my grandmother instead, so I did and she just smiled too and said that is their secret code. I got very curious and asked her “What does it mean?” She showed me a piece of paper written by my grandpa. It says:  It says: ""Happy Valentine's Day Daisy. I am blue ( my grandpa has been a bit depressed since my uncle died). Pink❤ and you are my sunshine. ""

She complained that her feet had been bothering her and asked if I could help her find a reflexology spa.  I’ve never been to one before and this is one of the best things I have ever found!

It’s underestimated how much a foot rub can do for you and they offer many other services such as full body massages...and here comes the best part: it’s at a fraction of what a massage would cost.  We paid $25 for a 30 minute foot massage and it seems like this is the going rate in my area.  For $40 you get a 40 minute table massage and 20 minute foot massage.  Massages at spas in my area are easily $150 for an hour.

How do they keep their costs down?  You are not in a traditional room by yourself.  There are about 15 beds lined up and are separated by floor to ceiling drapes.  There is no disrobing for the table massage other than taking off a jacket or sweater.  You wear your clothes and they put a sheet over you (LPT #2 wear a tank top and shorts).

LifeProTips,"This is the most important question the provider asks you once you go to use you benefits. Due to not knowing what your provider network is you could potentially pay out of pocket for something that would otherwise be covered. Example, you go to America's Best and pay out of pocket for everything since you were not aware of your network. You turn around and find out you have Spectera under UnitedHealth Care. You call our customer number 1-800-638-3120 and since you were not aware of specter we can only provider you with the out of network reimbursement which is usually no where as good as your in network benefits. So unless the provider you go to is in network and can bill for a previous date you're unfortunately SOL and there is nothing we can do for you. Also if you or a loved one have a medicare policy with UnitedHealth Care that has vision benefits included. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE check with the number on the back of the card to figure out the provider and who is in network. I have no idea what the companies issue is at the moment but they have sent out a packet that shows in and out of network benefits for glasses with a combined credit. This is actually not the case. Our plans typically are in network only for the medicare policies (very rare for the ones we do have out of network benefits.) Also because I get tons of calls about this. We only handle eye exams with refraction and for contact lenses and the purchase of glasses and contacts (typical policies only cover one or the other). We DO NOT handle glaucoma, diabetic eye exam, cataract eye exam and surgery, anything in your eye, eye injury or anything like that. Any thing like that or medically related goes to medical. Final notes, for the most part we don't issue ID cards. From supervisors not due to our choice but your employer's choice or whoever you signed up through. I personally don't even get an ID card so it's whatever. You honestly just need the ID number and the name of the vision plan which is Spectera. Our contact lens benefit is very specific (some plans they aren't as specific as in they have a flat copay for the fitting and set allowance for the contacts) Commonly our plans have a contact formulary list. Which is very specific in how you utilize it as well. In order for the fitting to be covered and for you to get your # of boxes covered for your copay you HAVE TO use your benefits for CONTACTS ONLY at the same office. So you'd get fitted for one of our formulary contacts and use your benefits for your boxes at the same office same day. Otherwise if you get fitted for something not on the list - you pay out of pocket for the fitting fee. If you need two different types of contacts - you pay for the fitting. If you go to Walmart, Costco, Sam's, Sear's, or Target - you pay for the fitting and in these three situations you pay out of pocket for the exam and use your allowance for the purchase. I know this won't apply to many but I'm just ranting due to lack of the company doing anything about it quick enough. I believe they are in the process of something right now but it's not going fast enough. Hope this helps some. If y'all have any questions let me know. Sorry if not a good formatting.

**My method of removing warts:**

* Burn the top of the wart by lightly tapping a soldering iron to it. Be very careful to not burn surrounding healthy skin
* Remove the skin with disinfected tweezers and/or a scalpel
* Continue doing this while trying to minimize pain. It should hurt a little but nowhere near as bad as liquid nitrogen. 
* Try to remove the wart all the down to the root so be prepared to bleed a little
* Once you think you have gotten as much of the wart out as you can: 
* Crush up an aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid)
* Drop some water onto the aspirin powder to make a paste that has the same consistency of wasabi
* Put the paste on the wart site. Try to avoid putting the paste too far onto healthy skin
* Wrap the entire site with duct tape

Step 2. Get immediately get into the water, make sure your stomach is always submerged.

Step 3.  When done, get out of the water, immediately head to the changing room and put in a pad/diva cup/menstruation underwear/etc.

How it works: When you submerge your body in water, the water pressure outside your body will not allow any menstrual blood to leak out of your uterus into your vagina.  You can swim and remain in the water for as long as you like, without worrying about contaminating the pool or the body of water.

Note:  If your blood flow is heavy enough to “leak” between cleaning yourself and walking into the water, this obviously will not work.  I recommend cleaning yourself off and remaining in the bathroom for as long as it takes to walk to the pool (maybe double that time just in case) and then wiping yourself again, to see if you are still clean.

You will not “leak” immediately after leaving the pool.  It takes a few minutes for your body to adjust, but I certainly would recommend changing as soon as possible.

LifeProTips,"If you are worried about privacy, the following search engines are a really good alternative.

[Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/) - Ecosia is a search engine that donates 80% or more of its profits to nonprofits that focus on reforestation. It considers itself a social business, is CO2 negative, claims to support full financial transparency and protect the privacy of its users. 

The company works with multiple organizations to plant trees in 16 countries throughout the world. Ecosia is available on Google Chrome and firefox as a default search engine by downloading the extension from the Chrome web store or Mozilla's Addon site respectively. Ecosia uses bing for web searches and has both bing and google maps. This one is probably the best google search alternative out there.

For more info - https://www.ecosia.org/?c=en
                         https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosia

[Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/) - Startpage is a web search engine which highlights privacy as its distinguishing feature. It gets it search results from google but does not track you. People who stick with google only for search quality can rely on startpage and I would recommend using it if you need results consistent  with google. For local searches like a particular restaurant in your area, I would suggest typing in the name of the place as well in the search bar.

They also have an awesome feature called anonymous view that shields your computer from website cookies. This way, retailers will not be able to optimize prices and have specific recommendations for you.

For more info - https://www.startpage.com/en/search/proxy-help.html
                        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startpage.com

[Swisscows](https://swisscows.com/?culture=en) - The biggest USP of swisscows is speed. The search engine is based on semantic data recognition that gives faster ""answers"" to queries. In addition, Swisscows does not store users' data. Swisscows also deems itself ""family-friendly"", with explicit results entirely omitted. Swisscows uses Bing for web search and also has a music search powered by soundcloud. I find the interface to be pretty neat.
For more info - https://swisscows.com/en/about

[ DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=hr) - DuckDuckGo is the market leader among the privacy focused search engines. It  has apple maps integration as well. This is a big plus as we don't have to rely on google for maps. The only complaint I have is that the search results are not as refined as  startpage. This could have something to do with the fact that they get their search results from bing. Keep in mind that this conclusion is based on anecdotal evidence that arises from my personal testing. Please do try it out yourself before coming to a conclusion. I would also say that the DuckDuckGO extensions are probably the best among the lot.

[MetaGer](https://metager.org/) is a  meta search engine for the internet. It is run by the non-profit NGO SuMa-eV. The source code is open (https://gitlab.metager3.de/open-source/MetaGer) and can be checked by anybody for it's protection shields against snooping. It is under the strict jurisdiction of German data protection laws, which are considered to be the strongest in the world. MetaGer lacks a good interface as it feels clumsy and outdated.
         
For more info - https://metager.org/about

There are a lot of other search engine alternatives like [Peekier](https://peekier.com/), [Qwant](https://www.qwant.com/), Searx etc that focus on privacy. But, I found the above mentioned five search engines to be the best of the lot.

I would also suggest using a browser like Firefox. But, there are  reports that google is deliberately [slowing down websites like youtube on firefox](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/232699/20180726/google-allegedly-slowing-down-youtube-on-purpose-when-using-firefox.htm),edge and other browsers. To bypass this, you could use a chromium based browser like [Brave](https://brave.com/). I use brave for the same reason and this way I don't miss out on any of my favorite chrome extensions as well. It also has an inbuilt ad blocker. 
Brave browser equipped with starpage and am good to go.

Even if the search results are decent, there is a possibility that you might feel that something is missing. Atleast, that's what I felt. But, I can guarantee you that it is nothing but lack of acclimatization.  Once you get used to seeing Startpage or Ecosia for a couple of weeks, you will not feel it anymore. After all, we have been using google for almost 2 decades and old habits are tough to be discarded.

There are viable alternatives available for other google products as well.  I have been using apple maps for some time and unlike before it is as good a google maps when it comes to navigation. You can also check out [HEREWeGo](https://wego.here.com/?x=ep&amp;map=25.2633,55.3087,10,normal). 

[DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) is amazing for translations and I can vouch for the fact that it is better than google translate. [Riot](https://about.riot.im/) is better than hangouts and [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/) is my go to for notes as it is very clean unlike google keep and is available on all major platforms.

[Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.fr/index.html) is a decent alternative to google docs. If you want a more established brand, you can go for Zoho. [Lychee](https://lychee.electerious.com/) is a good alternative to google photos and [Fruux](https://fruux.com/) is decent for calendars.  I use [Orangewebsite](https://secure.orangewebsite.com/index.php) instead of google domains as they have money back guarantee, and they accept bitcoin. 

For analytics you can check out [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/) which is an open source alternative to Google Analytics that’s [available on Github](https://github.com/usefathom/fathom). It’s minimal, fast, and lightweight.  Instead of gmail, i would suggest protonmail, but it's banned in countries like Russia, you could try Tutanota instead. For Youtube, it's better for me to not suggest an alternative. The best you can do is to use Brave browser and pray.

These are the alternatives that I use that work absolutely great for me. You can and should find the ones that work for you the best. It might seem difficult to break out  of the vendor lock-in especially look and feel of apps and integration. But, it is super liberating and is better than giving away your privacy for free to be capitalized and sold to you in the form of ads and ‘recommendations’.",LPT Do not jeopardize your privacy thinking that there is no viable alternatives to Google search.

LifeProTips,"I worked with a company that had a written byline in every employee's contract that any intellectual property developed during company time or on company property, was property of the company, and any and all legal claims to said property or it's royalties would be surrended to the company. I believe it was put in place to keep salary employees like me from spending all day working on side-jobs or passion projects while still receiving a full salary for the work they were ignoring/procrastinating. Also, to give credit and reimbursement to the company for any resources used along the way. Fair enough, not too bad.

Except it was. And to make it worse, almost no one knew about this clause in the employee contract. I only knew about it because I knew people who got burned because of it.

It became a problem for several of the doctors I worked with (and various other friends), because anything they published, no matter how minor, became the intellectual property of the company if the employee had spent ANY work time at all developing their idea/publication/project. Several docs would publish research, then be stripped of all royalties and ownership because they had worked on it at work or had consulted with other doctors while on company property. I had one friend in particular who was thinking of possible solutions to a common problem in transfusion. He came up with an idea for a simple machine that would solve the problem and make a certain kind of transfusion more readily available, and more conservative as far as blood product waste. He tried to secure a patent so he could proceed, but was told that, based on his contract, he would never see a dime of profit for his work, even though it was an outside project. Because he came up with the idea at work and consulted with me and a couple other coworkers, the idea no longer belonged to him, but the company.

The easy choice is always the right one. 
We know in your heart what the right choice is - It’s the path of least resistance.

A choice made with the ego instead of the heart is just an attempt to feel loved. A choice made in the hopes of eliciting a reaction tells us we’re worthy enough when there is a reaction. 

Any reaction good or bad can be misinterpreted as love. It’s not love. The reaction we were searching for or lack thereof, only deepens the void giving us a quick hit and the need for validation increases. 

As the void deepens our search for love becomes desperate and driven solely by ego - doing whatever we can to elicit the biggest reaction - this can play out in so many ways whether that’s by unconsciously manipulating others, turning to substances food etc.  

The energetic current of the universe  is pure love. 

Each time we make a decision and take an action inspired by the ego’s drive to feel important and worthy - the opposite occurs - the void deepens because we are going against the energetic current of the universe.

Eventually, unable to see how we can ever climb out of the darkness and longing, we make the determination that we’re unworthy of love. We become hopeless and life becomes meaningless. 

Our only fault is that we’re confusing validation from others with love. Of course we are, for some of us, that’s the only example of love we've ever known. 

Only we can make ourselves feel validated. Only we can fully tap into the loving energy that we need to fill that void. We can’t make others give us the love we need to fill that void, it will never be enough.  

Only we have the ability to choose to love ourselves deeply, compassionately and without abandon. 

When we fully love ourselves that void is filled in an instant. There’s no longing or despair - only peace. 

By choosing self compassion, we start to recognize there’s an endless supply of love - it’s all around us - infinite and overabundant. 
We don’t have to covet the love and keep it to ourselves - In fact the only way to truly love ourselves is to spread that love and share with others as if they are ourselves. 

We are all one. If you are worthy of love, so am I. If I am worthy of love, so are you.",LPT: We Can choose Love

LifeProTips,"""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."" -US CONST. amend. IV

Firstly, the history comes  from common law, or basically the law that inspired the writers of the US constitution  to put certain things onto the document. It protects against searches and seizure(taking by the government ) of your personal spaces or items without a good reason

Basic translation: 

The first part of the amendment protects US citizens against the unreasonable or  unwarranted search of all sorts of things, pockets, place of residence, their personal documents, etc., this protects people from unneeded invasions of privacy, personal security and most importantly against government intrusion into those things which  can lead to accusations of all sorts of stuff including unsubstantiated criminal charges. (I should note this also helps the government by deterring bad behavior by agents/officers of the law and ensuring they have professional and proper conduct when conducting searches)

Keep in mind ""shall not be violated,""ironically, certainly has exceptions.

The second half is regarding warrants (like ICE-T on law and order ""we got a warrant ho now sit down""). Luckily, warrants can help someone despite the portrayal of frightened criminals on TV being all you see. A proper warrant outlines the SPECIFIC places to be searched, SPECIFIC items to be taken and sometimes a specific amount of time to do that. If a search warrant it over-broad meaning it says ""you can search all of seasame street for however long you want"" then they may be looking for cookie monsters secret stash, but hugely invade Elmo and oscars privacy  doing so, this is not allowed and is called a ""general warrant"" something which has been viewed as a no-no for a looong time by courts. 


Notable exceptions: 

Probable cause

Outside of your owned space. When the police have a reason to believe there is a crime that has occurred  or is occurring in an area or related to an item and you are connected to, they, generally speaking,  have ""probable cause"" to detain and search you. If you are arrested, they will have to articulate exactly what that probable cause was and why they believed you were connected to a criminal behavior.
Note that probable cause, especially in motor vehicle stops, can be proven by an officers use of his senses, such as sight, hearing tasting etc. 

The Terry stop

In Terry v. Ohio, a landmark SCOTUS case, the court permitted an officer a fleeting unwarranted invasion of ones personal space in order for officers to ensure their safety and the safety of others. This severely limited the ""shall not be violated"" part of the amendment. It expanded  or was used to justify things like ""stop and frisk"" and the ""protective sweep doctrine"" in later cases. This case had to do with an automobile stop originally but it empowered the government a lot.
""Stop and frisk"" is very controversial and  occurs with a lowered probable cause element , and a ""protective sweep"" , just imagine a swat team securing places.

No-knock warrant

Traditionally when executing a warrant police needed to announce themselves and produce the warrant (ICE-T again). However, when there is a flight risk, suspicion of firearms, or their threats to the officers safety etc. they are permitted to enter unannounced. This limits the right given to retreat into ones home without government intrusion. However you might imagine in a situation with a dire need for stealth to ensure safety this is probably good, however it is arguably overused. 

Exclusionary rule

If officers enter a part of the premises or seize something they are not allowed by the warrant, that evidence may be excluded at trial. Known as ""fruit of the poisonous tree"" if the unwarranted search is the branch of the tree, and is rotten, then the fruit on that branch, or the evidence in this metaphor, is also rotten
This acts as a deterrent to ""unreasonable and culpable"" police behavior. That's great right? If the police find something in my attic and the warrant only said my living room I win! Right? Wrong .......you are totally wrong. As the courts often do, there is exceptions to this rule, the main one being known as ""good faith,"" meaning if the officer who overshot his warrant parameters acts in a way the court deems merely negligent or in other words, as an honest mistake, then the evidence is still allowed in most cases. A good defense lawyer will attempt to get good faith exception nullified by illustrating the wrongful conduct of the officer as unreasonable. 

Consent

Big one for vehicle stops here. The police may ask your consent to search any of your belongings or spaces, if you give them consent then you are allowing an unwarranted collection of evidence which is perfectly legal unless you were forced into giving that consent under duress. When encountering a situation where you're asked for consent, it is ok to say no, that's what the fourth amendment is for, the police will have to find probable cause to search you, and get a warrant.




Well that's it, there's so much more but it's a brief overview, if you look up any of these terms you'll be able to find a lot of info on them. Also I'm only in law school, so if there's any lawyers who want to correct any of this, please do. There's a whole piece I left out on how officers prove cause for a residential warrant because it's 5 am and I should be asleep.

All you need is a bath towel to do it.
Simply hold the body part against the towel so that you can feel that part in isolation , then proceed to move it in all possible range of motions.

LifeProTips,"Imagine 2 twins are born who pretty much have the same exact lives. Same mother, same father, same environment, went to the same college, had the same group of friends and even got a job in the same position at the same company. The only differences they have lie in the details. The small things. 

One of the twins, let’s call him productive Pete, spends a decent amount of his free time always attempting to better himself. He takes a very light one mile jog every day after work, he reads 10 pages a day of a book that’s either educational/motivational/or inspirational, and during lunch he always chooses the free water over the soda.

Now the other twin, let’s call him slacker Sam, Sam fell off somewhere and has a habit of living a hedonistic lifestyle. He always picks the can of soda over the water for lunch, always tells himself he will start the jogs with his brother next month, and only reads when he absolutely has to. 

It’s easy for slacker Sam to brush these things off because he looks at his brother Pete and tells himself “no biggie what Pete is doing. It’s not like he is going to be ripped after taking that one jog, It’s not like he is going to be much smarter after reading a mesley 10 pages of that book, and he isn’t even saving much money or getting any healthier skipping that soda, It’s only $1.25 and around 40 grams of sugar. I’m going to just live my life….the way I want to live it.” 

Sam thinks these little things aren’t going to make much of a difference. We also could rationally say that since these twins have the same life with such minor differences; most likely they will pretty much end up in the same position by the end…But in actuality it is precisely because of these minor details in their life that they will end up with drastically different experiences of life by the end of it. 

See one day of doing something isn’t going to make much of difference, most will agree on that. But when we add the magical ingredient of time to that equation, it’s clear to see that the small decisions we make are the most important ones. To Illustrate let’s look at slacker Sam and Productive Pete 1 year down the road following these same small differences in the daily decisions they make.

**In one year**, Productive Pete has 

\- jogged 365 miles 

\- read about 15 books 

\- saved around $450 bucks from choosing the water over soda and avoided the 14k grams of sugar along with it. 

And slacker Sam has none of that, In fact because of consuming the 14k grams of sugar and lack of exercise he gained 10lbs for the year, is a little lighter in his wallet, and isn’t really much wiser from a year ago apart from knowing the hottest Netflix series.

So now ask yourself, do you think jogging 365 miles would make a difference to your body? How about reading 15 educational books? Would that make a difference to the way you think. I can tell you right now, if you read just 10 good educational books it most likely will change you for the better. If you still don’t think so, let’s jump the timeline to 10 years down the road and look at the twins stats. 

**In 10 years** Productive Pete

\- Jogged 3,650 miles

\- Read 150 Books

\- Saved $4,500 (not to mention built the invaluable habit of saving money)

\- Avoided 310Lbs of Sugar! Just from choosing water over soda for lunch everyday

Slacker Sam’s Stats

\- Gained 100Lbs

\- Most likely has no savings and lives paycheck to paycheck

\- Most likely has some kind of insulin issue from too watch sugar and not enough exercise (Diabetes)

Now those numbers can really become alarming can’t they? In a year we become the result of our every little decision compounded. That same result just multiplies with each passing year. This compound effect is why the little decisions we make everyday are the most important decisions we make. **The decisions that are easy to do and easy not to do.**

The things that take us from failure to success are simple. So simple in fact that it’s easy to overlook them. Because when we look at them in the moment, they seem insignificant. There not things that take major effort and there is nothing heroic about them. Mostly it is just little things we do every day that most people won’t even notice. But in the end it’s what leads us to our success or our failure. Small changes added up overtime create big changes. Succeeding is more of a process rather than a single event like we tend to think

I first learned this philosophy from Jeff Olson in his book the slight edge. This philosophy lays a foundation for applying all the information we learn. A lot of times we lose faith in the information because it didn’t work. But more often than not it wasn’t the information – it was our philosophy.

If we ever want to succeed at something, we have to work consistently at it, not necessarily harder, consistently is the key word here. With this philosophy we can get from wherever we are to wherever we want to be in pretty much any aspect of our life. 

The Slight Edge is a philosophy, not a technique. It is something we ingrain in our brains and adopt it forever applying it to all of our future challenges in life. It’s known by many different names at this point, the compound effect, 1% growth, the growth mindset. Someone probably originally came up with it off the Japanese business philosophy known as KaiZen. which translated means “Change good” as opposed to changing bad. 

Whatever it’s called, they are all saying the same thing. If we improved in an area by just 1% a day, we would have improved in that area by 365% in 1 year. Having this philosophy ingrained is exactly how most of us average people succeed in life

With each passing minute and each choice that we make, the Slight Edge is at work – either for us or against us. Once you embrace this philosophy, you will know that if you do something long enough, you will get the results you want. But on the other hand, if we make the small errors of judgement long enough, we will suffer the consequences for it.

In time is where the curve starts to come into play. Our old habits will become stronger and stronger until we can’t escape them – for better or for worse. Once momentum starts to pick up and incremental change starts to kick in, the success and failure curve shoot off into opposite directions. The slight edge will have either helped us or hurt us 10 years down the line. There is no standing still option when it comes to the slight edge

Jeff has a great quote in his book about this point. “Time will either promote you or expose you.” The fact of the matter is, if we are not getting better, we are getting worse. The change that’s happening to us is automatic. 

Depending on the foods we eat and the exercise we do, our body will automatically change. Depending on the books we read or the tv we consume our mindset will change automatically. The change itself is a result of the daily choices we are making. Taking control of the daily decisions we make is taking control of the change that happens to us overtime. **We take control by just making a little bit of progress in any area of our life EVERY SINGLE DAY**

So, you’re probably asking, if the line between success and failure is so small and so simple to do, then why doesn’t everyone do it? Before I learned this philosophy most things I did in life were motivated by looking for the next big opportunity, the next big thing that was going to move me forward fast and far. If it was going to take too long, then I wasn’t really interested. Needless to say those big things rarely came. I lived like this for years before I was introduced to **the slight edge** philosophy. 

As Jim Rohn said “***Things that are easy to do are just as easy*** ***not*** ***to do***.” it’s Precisely because they are small decisions that won’t kill us immediately if we don’t do them today; That makes it is easy to not do them today. The small activities that make a difference overtime seem insignificant in the moment. In a society that tends to worship grand moments and quantum leaps, it’s easy to give up or stop doing the small actions required to deliver the results we’re wishing for.

This is further reinforced to us by corporations. Big Business wants us to give into instant gratification. They depend on us to lack impulse control. They want us to never use the slight edge to our advantage. Banks, credit card companies, marketers, and the economy in general profits off us giving into instant gratification and going down the path of least resistance. Society having a lack of self-discipline makes them rich.

On top of our psychology, society, and corporations working against us implementing the slight edge philosophy to our favor, we’re also not genetically programmed to make good decisions. Our ancestors had a short lifespan with all sorts of immediate dangers that could make that lifespan even shorter. This required them to think about “now” and only about “now”. We aren’t programmed to save money. We aren’t programmed to choose the harder, more beneficial path over the easier. **And we aren’t programmed to think about how our everyday decisions will affect us 10 years down the road.**

All of these seemingly insignificant decisions that we forget, take for granted, or procrastinate on; believing that the opportunity will still “be there tommorow”. These are all Slight Edge decisions that are east to do and easy not to do - SO MAKE SURE YOU DO THEM. Making those small correct choices day in and day out is what counts here. It’s the simple, seemingly trivial decisions we are making that put the slight edge to either work for us or against us. These choices usually don’t produce any immediate results, that’s why most of us don’t do them, but once this philosophy is ingrained in us we can almost see our compounded future through the single little actions we are taking today. **It’s a long-term process.** 

Think about it like this: on average it takes a new business 5 years to break even. So why not us?... It can take an acorn up to 50 years to become an oak tree but once it does, that oak tree stands strong for hundreds of years. So why would we think we work any differently? 

In the fast-paced world we live in, we all have that pressing sense of urgency. We feel like time is slipping away from us, which it definitely is, make no mistake. **But for the person who has the positive momentum of the slight edge on their side, time works FOR them rather than against them**. Time becomes our superpower 

Additional Notes

**Living the Slight Edge**  
 • One simple daily discipline

To get started, simply start by doing one daily discipline. The disciplines are whatever you define them to be, e.g. if healthy-eating is your goal, then the discipline could be as simple as choosing a healthy snack (e.g. a fruit) over an unhealthy snack (e.g. fries or chips) each time for one single meal at a time (lunch, dinner). His key message is that the small things you do daily add up. You can add another discipline in every 30 – 90 days. Go off of your intuition if you are ready to add another discipline in or not

**Here are here the 6 principles that can turn simple disciplines into a massive success.**

#### 1. Show Up.

No matter what show up every single day. You can beat out 50% of the competition just by showing up in your business or in the gym or eating healthy every single day. Easy to do… but also easy not to do.

#### 2. Be Consistent.

Don’t worry about the numbers, just strive for consistency and the numbers will be there in the end. You don’t have to be better, smarter, genetically gifted just be consistent and you will yield great results.

#### 3. Be Committed For a Long Period Of Time.

People want instant results, but true success takes time, success takes the compound effect which kicks in after you repeat the same action over and over and over again. Success is more like a marathon than a sprint. You must be willing to do what most will not do with discipline and persistence.

#### 4. Have Faith And A Burning Desire.

Everyone will be presented with problem and obstacles along their journey. When adversity hits this is what should keep us motivated to press forward. Successful people look at a problem and see opportunity. the obstacle that stands in your way becomes the new way

#### 5. Be Willing To Pay The Price.

The price of neglect is far worse that the price of commitment. The slight edge is simply to be willing to get uncomfortable now or you will pay the ultimate price of neglect and be very uncomfortable later in life.

#### 6.  Practice Slight Edge Integrity.

Slight Edge Integrity is all about what you do when no one is watching. It’s doing the thing you said you were going to do long after the mood you said it in has left you.  This can be difficult, but it really is the crux of integrity.

If you read this all the way through that's great and I hope it really hit home for a lot of you. I know when I first read the slight edge and started adopting the philosophy it really began to change my life for the better. Just think of every little decision your making and compound what that decision is going to lead you to in 10 years time. and if you don't like the answer it gives you, ask what you can be doing every day that will eventually lead you to getting what you want. Reading this may have scared the shit out of you like it did me but don't worry it's never too late, no matter how old you are. It really put things into perspective for me and I hope it does the same for all of you. To me personally this is the LPT of all LPT's

LifeProTips,"Coffee is a staple in my family. My dad, my brothers.

But, more recently, my brother, who has nothing to do in his spare time, has started increasing his intake for caffeine. He's a long-term recovering addict of other drugs. So the caffeine addiction is setting a pattern in him.

I feel like making another pot of coffee after he makes his second. It's a small pot for 2.5 cups. (5 cups per the 250ml rule). But I fight the urge by doing something, anything.

We just got a cat in the house, so maintaining the cat's belongings is a good start. Doing the recycle, doing dishes, cleaning up my room and looking for junk to sort out for more recycle. Going for a walk.

The caffeine has generated enough energy in me to do something or feel wild. And having more caffeine is a good rush, too. But there's got to be a limit.

He's not the easiest person to talk to. Our (divorced) parents didn't really teach him about responsibilities or humility (ie, being told when too much coffee is too much coffee, etc). They've summed it up as ""common knowledge"". Which is easy to take for granted and develop selfish tendencies.

Make use of the energy and save on consumption and resources. Something about A Bird in the Hand is **Worth Two** in the Bush ? The rush of productivity will be just as rewarding rather than sitting there banking all that caffeine.

Also, all this caffeine consumption will make you sensitive and act aggressive towards things that have trivial impact on your quality of life.","LPT: Coffee drinkers, if you feel like making another pot of coffee, do something else productive instead to fight the addiction."

LifeProTips,"I live and work in one of the most popular ski towns in the US and I’m surprised how many people rely strictly on booking hotels, restaurant reservations, and tours/activities online and miss out on a chance for a better deal/offer/time slot they could have gotten by calling the business directly 

Expedia deals are only attractive up front but have SO many hidden fees and the worst room move and cancelation policies. Priceline and hotels.com and orbitz are all the same company btw. And they’re all shit. Call the hotel you’re looking at and see if they’ll price match what you saw online. 9/10 they will and they hotel will see you as a higher tier guest for having booked with them directly. HotelTonight is a great app for price matching but if you book on the app you don’t get to pick your room type.

Restaurants (especially high end) don’t put all of their time slots and tables on Open Table. Call the restaurant directly at LEAST a day if not a week in advance and be willing to be flexible with the time. Restaurants are unlikely to book in for 6:30 because it’s hard to get other potential guests to book on either side of that reservation thus fewer turns on the table.

A lot of people are unaware, but every state has a website for unclaimed property, typically sums of money or stock from various places. 

Simply google “unclaimed property [your state]” and type in whatever information you want to search for. Personally I’ve found using your last name is most effective as you can get more hits that way for yourself and family. 

I’ve used it for every state I’ve lived in and found quite a bit in unclaimed property of mine, typically small sums of just over $100 a piece, though last year I found 76 shares of unclaimed IBM stock which was definitely a delightful bonus to receive. 

It’s also nice for claiming property for deceased relatives as long as you can prove relation, you never know what you’ll find! Happy hunting!",LPT: Check for Unclaimed Property

LifeProTips,"I treat social anxiety all the time as a CBT therapist. One of the easiest changes to make is attention training. When we’re anxious we’re more likely to be focusing on ourselves, our thoughts, our physical sensations etc which contribute to making us feel worse or you actually miss social cues. 

For example: thinking about how I feel red and might be blushing when at a party and talking to a new person. My focus is on inwards that thinking about the blushing is going to possibly make the blush worse and my anxiety worse. Instead, focus your attention on the person and what they’re saying or the environment. You will feel less anxious. 

Worth saying that attention training is a skill so you have to learn it and practice it! Maybe give it a google too for more information. Good luck all! X",LPT from a therapist: when in social situations and you feel anxious. Push all your attention outward into the environment and not inwards.

My wife and I planned a trip to Europe months ago for a romantic Valentine's getaway. Long story short on our first flight of a multi day trip someone was visibly Ill. As we we were leaving the plane she got up in the aisle while we were still sitting waiting for the crowd to start moving - and she coughed in my wife's face. 

We've spent the last 6 days in bed in a hotel room in Paris. We think it's just seasonal influenza because of how quick it came on. So no, I don't think it's coronavirus. However, our whole trip was ruined because this lady didn't have the decency to try to cover her cough.
