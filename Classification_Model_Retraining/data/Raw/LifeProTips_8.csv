LifeProTips,"Asking for what you want has an unwarranted stigma attached to it.  Maybe it's too many Karens insisting on special treatment and then demanding to talk to a mAnAgEr if they don't get exactly what they want.  Maybe it's the idea that it's selfish to ask for what you want.  Or maybe it's memories of the power monster in your life who didn't ask for what they wanted, they just extracted it from you because they could.

But negotiation isn't a bad thing.  You have wants and needs.  Other people have wants and needs.  Talk them through.  Sometimes an out-of-the-box solution can be found in the rubble of an unusual situation.  ""Can I have X?""  ""No?""  ""What if if I included Y in the deal?""  If the answer is still ""no"" after you've talked through the options, then accept it gracefully.

It was an aerospace maintenance/engineering career and throughout the industry it carries a tough guy persona that is highly unhealthy and toxic. For example, do you eat quinoa? Gay. Did you bring a salad for lunch? Must have grabbed your wife's lunch. Do you exercise? Rofl, just do 22oz. curls. Wear anything except cargo pants an XXL shirts? Metrosexual right there. I might mention 80% of my co workers in the past decade have been a combination of fat, skinnyfat, alcoholics, addicted to cigarettes and occasionally drug abusers.

Obviously there's nothing wrong with being gay, or metro, or sober, or anything else. But there's no reason to not do anything just because shallow, insecure people label you a certain way. If you have been, you have no idea what you are missing! 

Pedicures are amazing. Skincare feels great and it's way more important than people realize. Exercise solves so many problems you don't know you had. Quinoa is actually delicious and a great source of fiber and protein. A haircut that you actually love is one of the best confidence boosts. I've known people to say ""look at &lt;insert celebrity&gt;, no homo but damn"". Those celebrities do all this shit thats why they look so great. Im not saying you need to wear makeup and get a professional makeover... but none of this stuff is ""not manly"" and a lot of it has immediate benefits and is very accessible to men. (There's a lot of great hair stylists that charge a little more than shitty chains like supercuts that will shampoo and condition, straight razor, style, etc... im talkin a difference of 15 bucks.)

LifeProTips,"Say you have a die with six sides, every side has a number from one to six. Every time you throw the die, assuming no other factors, the probability of getting any specific number is 1/6 (one in six, because there are six sides and one number per side). Common sense would say that if you want, for example, a guaranteed 2, you just throw the die six times. But this is not the case:

As I said, the probability of getting a 2 is 1/6. In each throw, the probability of NOT getting a 2 is 5/6. In sattistics, you multiply the probabilities of independent events together. Thus, if you do six throws which are all independent, the probability of getting a 2 just once is: 6 \* ((1/6)\*((5/6)\^5)). This is because in a single set of six throws, any one throw can give a 2 (that's the 1/6) but all the others will give something different from 2, because we want 2 to show up once (that's the 5/6 raised to the fifth power). After doing that multiplication, you multiply the whole thing by six, because any of the six throws in the set can give a 2. That gives a probability of 40%. **If you throw a die six times, the chance of getting the number you choose just once is only 40%. The more times you want it to show up in a set of six throws, the less probability there is.**","LPT: If something has a ""one in N"" chance of happening, do NOT expect it to always happen after N attempts."

LifeProTips,"Navigating childhood as an introvert with pretty severe anxiety was difficult at times, but I created a system that my mom &amp; I used, and I just wanted to share with you guys.


Do you remember the feeling you'd get when you're put on the spot, asking your parent's permission to do something that you *didn't genuinely want to do?*
When your friend enthusiastically asks you to stay the night, or ask if they can stay over at your house, but you don't feel up to it?

(This was common for me. My social meter would be on 'empty', and I'd be in a silent panic trying to scramble for a way to explain that, without hurting feelings and damaging friendships.)


The system revolved around my use of **""Can I?** and **""May I?""**
My mom knew to look for my use of, or a lack of manners in the way I asked.


- ""Hey mom, **can** vlevkim stay the night?""   ""Sorry, not tonight, no.""


- ""Hey mom, **may** vlevkim please stay the night?""   The may and the please meant this was a genuine ask, and I was hoping for her to allow it.


She knew that if I asked properly then I was up for it, and I'd like her to consider.
When I asked if they COULD stay, or if I COULD participate in whatever, she would know to answer with a ""no"".
Even if I repeated, and asked ""Please, can I?""...I'd receive a more firm response, still a no.

The mindful wording was never detected by any friends.



If you don't agree with the use of this system, I know that it's not for everyone, but here is why I feel it was beneficial enough for me, to be used with my daughter.


We need our children to learn to be assertive, and to communicate, but if your child is showing empathy, not wanting to let their friends down, empathy is much harder to teach someone later on. We can teach tactful ways to turn down an offer later on, I'd be happier honoring their choice to do what feels right without stress.


On top of that, my need to pass on an invitation could be a million things a parent would never guess. I had a very close friend who was the most amazing human, but their parents kept a horribly dirty kitchen. If they're asking me to stay the night, I'm trying to keep from eating dinner prepared there. Or I'm in a home where I see very little food in the fridge, but I know parents are going to be kind enough to cook for me if I stay over. I'd rather go home, and know I can see the friend tomorrow at school. 

Maybe I'm at an after school activity, asking if ""I can go to vlevkim's house after the activity?""....No, I can't, because I've seen their parent in passing and my gut says that I love my friend, but never want to be around their parent.


A million tiny reasons, and a parent wouldn't know.



Manners are important, and compassion is important, but I also feel that it is important to not dictate how our children socialize. Additionally, it is SO important to teach manners in a way that doesn't make our children feel forced into submission because certain things are polite.

It's a system that I feel, as a parent, can help us teach the idea of autonomy, and help from an early age to show our children that THEY should choose what they do and don't like, and that we will support their choices.


Not to say that I wouldn't sit down and discuss things if my child chooses to pass up every invitation, but by allowing these choices to be made, we have more opportunity to discuss *why* they may pass up opportunity, and we learn more about our child.


We all have an intuition and will be making choices throughout our entire lives - I believe in teaching them to honor that intuition, and empower them by supporting them through their choice making experiences.

First, get a vacuum cleaner with a long attachment tube. If there are a lot of wasps, or if they are particularly aggressive, wear some loose clothing with long sleeves and a hood to cover your neck. Consider goggles as well.

Find a comfortable spot near the hole where you see the wasps going in and out.  Turn up the power on the vacuum.

Wasps will have to land on a surface and then walk the last few cm into the hole. This is when you get them with the vacuum.

Be prepared for this process to take some time. Continue until at least 5 minutes have gone by without a new wasp arriving back from foraging.

I recommend to put the vacuum bag in the freezer to minimize their suffering. The cold should kill them quickly and relatively painlessly.

You may have to repeat this process after a few days as new wasps are born.",LPT: Avoid chemicals by vacuuming wasps

Names of conditions, possible complications, things to look out for, medication instructions...if you’re not also a medical professional (and even if you are!), important information can be difficult to remember in the moment.

After using an elevator you can help out your fellow humans by sending it back!

For  example, I usually park on the 3rd floor of my work's parking garage.  I  take the elevator down, then enter the office building.  Then I take  another elevator to the 3rd floor to my office.

In  the morning when I exit the garage elevator I hit the ""3"" button on my  way out.  I do this because I know there is a 99% chance the next person  who needs to use the elevator is going to come from 3 down to ground  floor.  When I exit the office elevator I hit ""1"" on my way out.  Again  99% chance next guy is gonna need to come up.

LifeProTips,"1. If you see somebody in need for help, only approach if you don't put yourself in imidiate danger, just call police or an ambulance, theres no need for you to get hurt too. 
2. If the person seems unconcious, talk to them, if they dont respond shake them (lightly, you dont want them to jolt around). Before you continue, make sure you called police/EMT, maybe you wont have the time later.
3. ALWAYS protect yourself; watch out for hazards, try to avoid blood and other body liquids, etc.
4. The person doesn't respond, so you check if she/he's breathing; hover your head above their mouth, look at their chest; if you feel their breath and/or see their chest heaving, their good. 
5. If they don't breath, look if there's anything obstructing it from the outside (maybe you haven't seen the corset crushing them). If not, open their mouth and take a look, if needed pull the tounge back, but try not using your fingers, if you cant see something there, carry on.
6. If there is no visible damaged to their neck/spine/head, lay them flat on their back, make sure to take of puffering clothes like jackets, for an easy approach, draw an invisible line from the belly button to the center of where their nipples would sit, if they were a man.

Interestingly, it's a common argument about a fear of artificial intelligence that it will be ""programmed"" to make people smile and will then simply go around physically altering the shape of people's mouths into a smile. Physically making someone smile like this is almost as sloppy and inefficient as telling someone to smile, if your goal isn't just as superficial.

To genuinely ""make"" someone smile, work at the things that make them genuinely happy and satisfied and unable to resist smiling at the results you produce about them and the world.

Okay, so basically a ghetto version of “rice porridge”...

You can make something texturally similar with a package of plain instant oatmeal and either a package of cream of wheat or 3TBSP of malt’o’meal. Cook either stove top or in the microwave to your desired texture then season to taste.

You can even cook egg in it!!! (Tip: most microwave instructions for microwaved scrambled eggs do so in 30 second increments. DON’T!!! Just add it in with your preferred amount of water and cook in 1minute increments on high, then stir and repeat until done. The extra water allows for longer cooking times.)

LifeProTips,"So I know you're not supposed to piggy back off of LPTs here but I think this is super important information to share. 

  I am a long hail truck driver in the US. I live OTR ( over the road) most of the time in my semi truck with my spouse. Here are some general LPTs for dealing with semis on the road because I saw one trending and it wasn't that great of advice imho. 

  1. If you cant see my mirrors, I can't see you. Generally true but I also can't see you if you can see my mirrors in certain spots. If you're on my passengers side/ right side of the vehicle I probably can't see you. Just as a general rule. We are trained to look as much as we can but shit still happens. 

  2. Don't hang out behind me. Ever. Unless there's a lot of traffic but you should still maintain a distance from me that will allow me to see your vehicle behind me. If there's no traffic and you can pass me just do it. Don't sit behind me for an hour because your headlights are blinding me and I am encouraged to slow down and get you to go around me because it could be a sign that I could be high jacked if someone is hanging around me too long. We are trained to look out for things like this. 

  3. If you can pass me, please just do it. I don't want your lights blinding me anyway and I'm governed as most company drivers are. Governed means that the speed of my truck is set at a maximum ( ie 65 mph) and I can't go any faster than that. Which sucks because companies demand you hurry up and get to your destination as fast as possible. 

  4. Driving in front of me? Go the speed limit please. If I'm governed at 65 and you're driving 64 mph I'm going to get a beeping sound saying I'm too damn close to you. And that sets the front camera off and then I get in trouble. So I have to slow down to get way behind you. Which eats into my allotted time to make a delivery on time. Just please stop driving 10 miles under the speed limit. 

  5. That brings me to texting/ distracted driving. I can see you texting.  I can see every. Single. Thing. You. Are. Doing. I can see you picking your nose. Talking on speaker phone with your phone in your hand. I can see your name on facebook or Instagram. I can see you jerking off. Literally 9/10 vehicles that pass me are texting or scrolling on their phones. You have to stop doing this. If not for anyone else, do this for yourself. If you're ever in an accident with a semi you will likely not survive it. 

  6. Driving on the side of me? Just pass me. The left lane is for passing. The right lane is for chilling ( as long as you are going the speed limit and not inhibiting my driving). Don't chill in the left lane because other cars and trucks want to pass you. Even if they are speeding it's better to just let them. They'll get pulled over one day. But you never know if you're hindering someone from passing you that needs to. Like a cop. Or ambulance way down the road. You may not be able to see it but I can see miles back how far you're hindering traffic. 

  7. Your headlights. For godssake people. Don't turn your brights lights on on the interstate. Why do people do this. I know a lot of people have these bright lights nowadays that arent "" bright lights "". So I try to be calm about it. But almost every day someone is driving the opposite direction with bright lights on or behind me with them on. Your brights can be seen in my rear view mirrors and it makes it difficult to see the road. Which is dangerous. 

  8. Accidents on the shoulder. If your car breaks down move it to the shoulder with your hazards on. If you dont have your hazards on I'm probably not going to move over into the left lane for you because I assume the car is abandoned. And if another car is broken down on the shoulder with their hazards on and I am able to get over safely to make some room for them then I'm going to try. So please don't try and gun it around me the minute you see my blinker. There's a reason I'm getting over. 

  9. Flashing your lights at me doesn't mean "" hey I'm here DONT get over. It means "" There's space between us so you CAN get over."" I've had a few miscommunications I think with cars over the years. I put my blinker on to get over. They flash their lights. I get over. They start wilding blaring their horn. For truck drivers, if someone flashes their lights it means "" You are safe to get over in front of me because there is an adequate amount of space between us"". So if a truck driver wants to get over you should either A. Slow down to allow them to.  Or B. Pass them. I know you can see my blinker. I have 6 on each side. And if you can't then you need to be paying more attention to the road. 


  Sorry if I come across a little crass here. But I've been a driver for 4 to 5 years now and on the road for like 9 with my spouse. I've seen it all by this point. I'm an extremely cautious driver with a half million safe miles under my belt. But I can't say the same for every other driver on the road. I have this belief that educating others will eventually lead to safer roads and less road rage. I also have seen at least 3 dead bodies in the past few years on the road and it's not something I ever want to see again.

LifeProTips,"Honestly, this is almost like a superpower if done right. It sounds odd or awkward at first, but it really works.

From Sean Covey's book, *The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Teens*:

&gt;Think like a mirror; it doesn't judge and it doesn't give advice. It reflects. Mirroring is simply repeating back in your own words what the other person is saying and feeling.

As an example, let's say your significant other comes to you angry that you left the TV on overnight. ""Hey, you forgot to turn the TV off before bed! Our electric bill is going to cost a fortune!"" Now, simply repeat back what they said. You can start it with ""I hear..."" or phrase it as a question. ""I hear you saying that I left the TV on before bed, and our electric bill is going to cost a fortune?""

As awkward as this sounds, I've had exchanges that would have been big arguments in the past cool off almost immediately after a bit of mirroring. And most of the time the other party doesn't even notice that you're mirroring them, especially after you've practiced a little. It comes very naturally to me now.

I use mirroring for even the smallest exchanges. If my friend comes to me all excited that she's going on a road trip, I match her affect by becoming excited myself and repeating her words before responding to them. (""You're spending the night in NYC with Becky? That's great!"") I also use this a lot at work. If my boss tells me ""Hey Mr. Skippy, could you take that pallet of water out back?"" I'll say ""Take that pallet of water out back, got it!"" (In commercial aviation, pilots are actually required to Mirror instructions back to air traffic control to prevent misunderstandings in communication!)

If anything, my only complaint about mirroring is that sometimes it works too well. I've had complete strangers share their darkest secrets mere minutes after meeting them, especially if I combine mirroring with *another* technique called Unconditional Positive Regard. But that's for another LPT!

P.S. In the NLP community, mirroring refers to mimicking another person's mood, posture, mannerisms, and speaking style to build rapport. This is related to, but a little different from mirroring as discussed by Sean Covey. Influential American therapist Carl Rogers used the term ""reflective listening"" instead of mirroring.","LPT: ""Mirroring"" is a simple but extremely powerful communication technique that helps the other party feel that they've truly been heard"

LifeProTips,"EDIT: Do not just change the way you pay your loan institution on your own without contacting your lender and ensuring that they provide the ability to modify your payment schedule and apply the payments in the manner described below; always ask for documentation as well. In addition, if you have high interest credit cards or other debt, you should pay that down first before paying down your lower interest debt. I took these two points for granted in writing up this LPT and I thank the posters that made it clear that I should have included them.

If you're paid bi-weekly this could be a no-brainer for many, and the key to ""simplifying your budget."" If you time your accelerated bi-weekly payment to your paycheck, you have the same amount left over after each check instead of one large payment due roughly ever other paycheck; sometimes that can be a hassle when your checks don't fall right in line with those monthly due dates. Furthermore, and more importantly, you can drastically reduce the interest you pay over the course of the loan and you'll also reduce the length of the loan.

What's an accelerated bi-weekly payment?

Let's take this example:

You just got a $250,000 mortgage at 4%, 30 year fixed. Your monthly payment on the mortgage (not including taxes, etc) would be $1,193.54. If you multiply that by twelve payments, you pay $14,322.88 a year in interest and principle. Divide $14,322.88 by 26, or the number of two week periods in the year, you get $550.86, a number I'll bring up in a moment.

Now, if you take that $1,193.54 and divide it by two, you get $596.87. If you pay this amount every two weeks you'll be paying about $46 more every two weeks than if you were to pay semi-monthly (that $550.86 I mentioned above,) and that amounts to an extra full payment of $1,193.54 a year that goes directly to principle. Your total yearly payout is $15,518.62.

What are the results?

Here's the interest you'd pay over the life of the loan (360 months) with a standard monthly payment of $1,193.54:

**$179,673.77**

Here's the interest you'd pay over the life of the loan (now only 310 months) with an accelerated bi-weekly payment:

**$151,482.12**

Not only are you **saving $28,191.64** during the life of the loan, but **you are also** **paying the loan down faster, and will have paid off your house in just under 26 years instead of 30.**

Some banking institutions allow you to make this change online in a couple of clicks; others you may need to call. Check your online account to see if there's an option for adjusting your payment schedule.

Bonus: you can often do this with your car payment as well. Take the monthly amount you pay and divide it in half. Tell your loan institution that you'd like to move to an accelerated bi-weekly payment and that's the amount you'd like to pay every two weeks.

Of course, you can do this even if you don't get paid bi-weekly, but for those juggling their largest bills every month without a fixed 1st and 15th or 15th and 30th paycheck, this has the added bonus of simplifying your budget.

REPEAT EDIT: Do not just change the way you pay your loan institution on your own without contacting your lender and ensuring that they provide the ability to modify your payment schedule and apply the payments in the manner described above; always ask for documentation as well. In addition, if you have high interest credit cards or other debt, you should pay that down first before paying down your lower interest debt.

LifeProTips,"This paraphrased quote from an interview with multi-millionaire Manny Khoshbin really resonated with me. It's a beautiful analogy to persevere and press-on in the face of adversity, all in a wholehearted effort to achieve your goals. When you climb the mountain, you are building yourself. When you have reached the top and begin to pour the water, you are putting yourself out there in the world and letting your chips fall where they may.

What really touched me was the fact that I wrestle with the fear of being 'denied' to my dream career as a software engineer. I fear that I'd never get an interview and if I do get interviews, I fear that I'd fail them and never receive and offer. I fear that after all of the hard work I've put in, after all the schooling debt I have taken on, that I'd still not be good enough. Manny really hit the nail on the head with this quote. Don't live in fear. Believe in your journey. Believe in yourself. Persevere through all the obstacles that confront you and don't be afraid to climb the mountain. Hold onto your resolve with the greatest tenacity and don't be afraid to pour the water down the mountain.

LifeProTips,"to keep this as short as I can, the back story is that my ex and I broke up on June 3rd. while he is the one who left me, there has been a lot of back and forth (as you can imagine) about whether we work through things and give it another shot or we just give each other space and wait to see how this all plays out. in his words exactly, the last time we had spoken was Saturday, June 13th. I was on my way to Texas to spend time with friends and family, as my company is still remote until at least October 2nd of this year. some context from the last conversation: it was bland. I voiced yet again how I felt because I just feel (rightfully so) deep in my soulllll that this simply cant be the end of us. we had a great relationship, minus, of course, the everyday hiccups that couples tend to face + add some sweet quarantine in there where both of you are working from home in an 800 square foot apartment.

the last words we spoke to each other were over gchat... modern romance, I know. the previous day, which was a Friday, he came over to what *was* our apartment after we both got done with work and gave me back a few more of my things, as well as grabbed the rest of his things. he left a couple of things, I think out of sheer forgetfulness - but I’m going to tell myself it’s because he didn’t want that to be the last time we saw each other. the mood was somber... very calm, not arguing, but a little quirky and awkward and uncomfortable. almost like neither of us knew what to say or how to act. overall, it went well. I texted him after because we very dramatically had to follow each other down the highway for about 10 minutes, considering the routes we were taking to get to the separate places we were going were along the same path. I texted him like an idiot (because I couldn’t play hard to get up until after that point to save my life) and said “you don’t have to say it back, but I love you forever mr. will always feel kindred and connected with you. thanks for coming to say bye.” he responded, “I love you too. be well.” 

fast forward to the next day. I’m on my way to Texas listening to a book on audible titled Love Is Not Enough by Mark Manson... great listen by the way, if you need a recommendation in a similar situation. I sent the gchat. I suggested that maybe when I get back to Colorado from Texas, where he and I both still reside, that we could possibly get together for a nice dinner or movie day for some true closure. in my opinion, there was no imminent straw that broke the camels back. neither of us physically cheated on the other and when he left it felt surreal. it still feels surreal. anyhow, I wrote something along the lines of this and got no response... although, he was responding beforehand about one question I asked regarding who he would continue to communicate our break up with between mutual friends. after no response, I said, “should I take your silence as no?” he responded, “I truly don’t know how this will all play out. that’s all. drive safe.” I left it at that.

fast forward again to tonight, June 16 - well now 17th 12:45am Texas time. he’s in Colorado so it was only 11:45pm. he normally goes to bed early, but remember when I said earlier that I felt in my soul this wasn’t the end. I know he’s hurting, that’s inevitable. BUT. I’ve been sick to my stomach all day. following that Saturday conversation on my drive to Texas, I hadn’t talked to him at all, whatsoever. no calls, texts, dms, story views.. he had viewed every single story I posted since then. they were all stories about BLM or just having a good time with my friends, nothing to provoke jealousy if that is what you are thinking. I’ve really been doing my part to remain cordial and not psycho, which for me is an accomplishment. especially considering how much I am hurting.

the moral to this story though, since now I’m rambling — I spend all night talking with two of my best girlfriends. we are discussing what he’s likely thinking or going through. I honestly could not tell you, other than the obvious fact that a person who loves you as much as we love each other is hurting. my friend and I get ready for bed and lay down to sleep. I’m literally racking my brain of all the possible scenarios you do in this situation, what is he doing, who is he talking to, will we ever make this work? just praying and wishing that I can find some truth and density in this soon. my mental health needs it.

I set my alarms and fall asleep thinking about him. I had JUST fallen asleep when I hear my phone buzzing like crazy and turn it over — it’s him. I’d like to think since I’m half asleep still, that’s why I answer... mind you I have been doing a great job of giving him space the last 3 days. when I answer, the phone is silent for 8 whole seconds and then he hangs up. my idiot ass calls back, I think because subconsciously (obviously) I wanted it to be him calling to check on me and just say, “I miss you, come home.” not the case. I call him back because at this point I’m wondering if something is wrong... sure enough, no answer.

my question here: please keep in mind he hasn’t called me since the beginning of last week and uses his phone all day everyday for work... my number wouldn’t have been anywhere near the top or in his favorites for a butt dial. also, the chances of butt dialing on an iPhone are slim to none, I’ve never successfully done that. I wrestle with myself about if I should text him or not, but do anyway. I kept it short and said - “I was asleep when you called. Think you hung up so I called you back. Hope everything is okay, here if you need to talk” no response yet and I know he had to of been awake just 20 minutes after that phone call when I texted him. 

obviously guys AND girls voice your opinion... but if a guy got to the end, please enlighten me on what you believe was the motive here with the phone call? should I not have answered or even called back? or texted? he was viewing my IG stories each day as I mentioned earlier, but around 5pm today I hid him from my stories, because I know from friends that I’m hidden from his and not to play games, but we have to play fair right? 

now I just took three Tylenol PM’s because I obviously can’t get back to sleep. please help. my heart is broken and my mental health is certainly not in tact

I used to be a privileged private high school student , which I never used to be responsible for a lot of things, Also the feeling that mattered a lot to me is that i'm actually aging and entering the 20ish phase which scares me the most because its full of serious steps in your life like college grad , finding work, and marriage. Also, The fact that i'm almost done with 25% of the time that left to me on earth concerns me from time to time. I regret that i didn't care to my health and I used to ate a lot of unhealthy food , but I got high marks and used to travel. I feel like the competitiveness I used to have for college entrance in my grades - after i applied to the college that i wished and got accepted - now i feel it didnt really matter because i sacrificed a lot of my health-overweight- to enter it , while my friends where enjoying their health. also my brother that was almost the same age as me died last year 11 months ago who was my backbone that i used to rest on and my bestfriend and now i had to communicate with other people to satisfy the big gap he left which is exhausting.

LifeProTips,"I know this sounds like obvious advice, and I know that it might be easier said than done in some people’s circumstances. But when COVID first hit, I saw a lot of posts about students losing their jobs and were then panicking because they were unable to pay rent. And when I was in college, I knew so many people who lived paycheck to paycheck and couldn’t afford food and other stuff because they were barely able to pay rent - most of the income from their part time job went to rent. 

What I always did was get a summer job or two, and save up the entirety of my lease so I could continue to pay my rent comfortably...even if I did lose my job during the school year, or needed to quit to focus on school. So if my rent was $500 for ten months, I’d work as much as possible during the summer to save $5000 - or at least get as close to $5000 as I possibly could (and even better if I could save more). 

That helped reduce a lot of stress in that I didn’t have to worry about making enough money to pay rent each month. That meant I could work at an easy job for like 10 hours a week during the school year, and whatever money I made there went to food and gas.

When ordering flowers, always look up a local shop in the town where the flowers are going, and call them directly or use their own website.

When you google “Send Flowers to Wherever, USA” and click one of the first few links, or if you order directly on a Funeral Home’s page, a company like Teleflora or 800-Flowers will take your $100 (say) and send an automated order  for maybe $60 to a local shop to make and deliver your order.  The florist is going to try to replicate the picture you clicked for $50, adding $10 for delivery.  It’s the best they can do.

And your recipient will get a cute lil $50 arrangement for the $100 you sent.  The big company is also taking advantage of the local shop on many other levels we won’t discuss here.

LifeProTips,"I'm always surprised when I go for walks and see trampolines in people's yards, most of them still don't have netting around them. Now, I love trampolines, they're an awesome thing for a kid to have. It's fun, it keeps them active, and with friends over there's tons of games you can play on them. When I was a kid (around 2004?) I got a trampoline for my birthday after months of begging for it. My parents specifically looked for one that had netting around it, because they had seen people get seriously injured falling off of trampolines. And you know what? The netting didn't detract from the experience one bit. I had that trampoline set up for years. Tons of other kids went on it, some more careless than others, and we always had fun. Some minor injuries still happened on it, obviously, it's a trampoline so you have to expect that sometimes, but in all those years there was never anything serious enough that required a hospital visit. Very rarely we would get tangled in the net, but trust me, it's 1000x preferable to landing smack down on the cold hard ground.

In fact, you know what? The netting lends itself to even more possibilities for fun. I firmly believe it's a superior experience for a kid. For example, we had a garden hose with one of those nozzles that let you adjust the water pressure and spray direction and stuff. On a hot day my friends and I would put on bathing suits and set the hose up on the top of the net. We'd adjust the nozzle and pretend that we could control the weather, and could choose whether to make it rain really soft or spray out like a firehose. (Even better with squirt guns and water balloons.) Sometimes we put it on the strongest, narrowest setting and tried to do tricks over the stream, pretending we were secret agents dodging lasers. That was way too much fun. It also allowed us to play trampoline soccer. We'd designate a spot on the net as our goal, and we could kick the ball as hard as we want, safe in the knowledge that it wasn't going to leave the trampoline (unless it went too high up, which it sometimes did). And we could do all this while bouncing! Putting exercise balls on it was similarly a lot of fun. I loved to belly flop on them and kick them around. And in the fall you could scoop a ton of leaves onto it and try to make the biggest leaf cloud you could with your bounces. Fuck, writing this is making me want to go back so badly. That trampoline was one of the most essential parts of my childhood.

The reason I bring this up is because an (adult) relative of ours was bouncing on her kids' trampoline, no net, accidentally bounced off, landed on the ground and broke her neck. She's paralyzed now. It's horribly tragic, but all I can wonder is, why the fuck did they get a trampoline with no net?! They've been making them for decades! This kind of injury shouldn't even happen anymore, if her kids were as careless as her it could've happened to them too!","LPT: if you want to buy a trampoline for your kids, get one with netting around it.

Now on Reddit, I’m still in r/Liberal and r/Democrats but I’m also in r/Conservative and r/Republicans. I don’t always agree with the views in those subreddits but they challenge me to think more critically of my political views and often offer insights that I would never have thought of on my own. Also, it’s sometimes interesting to see two wildly different spins on the same current events, side by side in my feed.

Since 2016, the US has undoubtably become more politically polarized. When I found out my dad was a Trump supporter I was disgusted by him. But he’s not someone I can just “cancel” from my life, so I’ve had to sit with it for a while. Getting out of my liberal echo-chamber has helped me understand him way better.

# QUESTIONS ARE THE ANSWER

Questions influence our thoughts, feelings, and actions. A colleague asks you, “Do you find this project as frustrating as I do?”, It creates negative thoughts and feelings. Your brain is now trying to figure out how frustrating this stupid project is, and will focus on circumstances that you might not have found so frustrating in advance. Who helped? No one! On the contrary, the mood is negative, any motivation destroyed, you feel bad. If you are asked the other way around “This project is great! Have you ever considered what we can do with our concept in motion? “This question puts you directly in a positive mood. Your brain is looking for an answer to a positive question.

Also, and especially the questions of how we set ourselves influence our feelings and actions. If you ask yourself, “What do I want to do next?” Your brain is looking for answers to this question and will find them: clothes, cars, TVs. But you might also ask, “What must the plan I need to achieve my financial goals look like?”. The fact is, the questions we ask determine the goals we focus on.

But watch out what questions you ask yourself the whole day. “Damn, why does it always rain when I have to get out?”, “Why am I doing everything wrong?”, “Does the idiot want to upset me ?!”

Instead of being trapped in negative and unproductive thoughts, we should ask ourselves what we can learn from unpleasant situations so that something does not happen again.

They assume that you are on ""the Other Side"" and they are afraid or angry at what it means to be on ""the Other Side.""   You are likely a more complex person than the person they are picturing.    


I have had some luck at changing people's minds after just talking to them on a human level, and finding something to relate about first, so it's not just a game of ""points.""   On the internet, it looks like the game is often ""who is going to have the last word?""   When we look at it that way, there is no room for change it's just a game of My Thing is better than Your Thing.  If you really care about the big issue you're discussing, it can help to learn the skills to change minds.  When you find something to agree on, you're first defusing the anger, bringing it down to earth, and then you can think more clearly.    


Communication is important toward change that you want to see.  

  
For some bonus tips, here is a recipe for ""Dysfunctional Communication.""  These are barriers to communication. You can read it as a list of What Not To Do:  


 \- Do not listen, only talk.   

\- Don't ask any questions

\- Do not see each other's common (flawed) humanity.

\- Judge first, based on little information.   

\- Let your (very likely justified) anger at an opinion you see on the internet make you overestimate how many people hold that opinion in real life.

\- Aim your arguments at your imagined repulsive enemy instead of seeing the real complexity of the person in front of you.  

\- See a misinterpretation as a disagreement or rejection of your idea.  

\- Don't consider that there could be multiple initial interpretations of your phrasing and it may need clarification.  

\- Turn the other person's argument into a meme or hashtag to dismiss it.   (Fun and easy but..the impact ends there.)

\- Underestimate the power of real communication and sharing of life experiences.  

\- Leave compassion behind.   Put limits on compassion. 

\- Assume we have nothing in common  (there is usually more in common than not.)

\-  Assume there are only 2 extreme sides and if you're not on one then you must be on the other.   (This freezes participation for fear of judgment/exclusion.)

\- Don't look inward,  don't get introspective.  Push away self doubt.  Push away humility.  

\- Don't accept imperfection, assume the worst intention from a flawed attempt to join a conversation.   

\- Assume a mind cannot be changed.   

\- Assume there are only 2 possible answers to every problem.  

(All dichotomies are false &lt;-- even this one right here)

&amp;#x200B;

If we can communicate better one on one,  in person or online, we can do  more together.    The pace of the internet makes this difficult but it can pay to slow down and take the time to talk things out.  Even though we may not always feel the emotional capacity to talk things out.  But  when we do, we can try.","LPT: Find at least one thing to agree on first when you are debating or arguing with someone who is on ""the Other Side"" of the issue."

LifeProTips,"Just listen. That’s it!

We consume all day long. Media, shows, movies, music, articles, books, podcasts. Yet, we don’t listen to each other. We fill ourselves with stories and opinions and when it’s time to listen to fellow human beings, we have to give our two cents. We just react. Maybe if we just listen, we can do some good. Maybe we can work towards letting others get out what they want to say without judgement. We can take in all sorts of information and yet we can’t take in what someone is telling us in person. All these forms of media aren’t specifically directed at us, so we just take it in. But when someone is right in front of us we feel compelled to give our own opinions. There’s nothing wrong with giving our opinion, but sometimes we aren’t aware that we are not letting the other person get out what they want to say. We’re so quick to judge the situation instead of letting the situation be what it is.

Listen to your children. Listen to your partner. Listen to your friends. Your colleagues. Your acquaintances. The people you don’t agree with. Maybe we can learn something. Maybe we can be better. Just maybe.",LPT: Listen

The first step in avoiding that is by reaching out to the landlord and they may have a solution or be able to get you on a payment plan.

LifeProTips,"Hey guys,

so I am currently studying finance, and want to switch to a better university.

I have to be honest here, I didn't know what I really want to do, so I was more focused on thinking about that, than studying.

I basically didnt do ANYTHING and obviously didnt get any credit points.

Now, when applying to the other college, I would have to send in my CV with my current proof of performance at the uni i am at.

I am pretty sure, that they wont accept me anymore if they see that I am here for 6-12 months doing absolutely NOTHING.

I am doing stuff on the side, like trying out some small business ideas and going to a language school, but honestly, I cant show ANYTHING regarding my studying at the current university.

Do you have any advice/solution/trick that I should follow in order to fix this ?

Some people might say: ""just complete some exams now so you can atleast show smth"" , but I sadly dont have time for that, as I have to prepare for the admission for the uni i want to go to (admission tests, presentation, 1+ month internship etc.)

I am really lost at this point and as my grades in highschool were pretty sh*t, I could still fix that with a motivational letter and all that, but that wouldnt mean anything, if I then show up with a record of me being immatrikulated for a year without gaining any credit points.

Is there anything I could do ?


Anything helps!!:-)

Thank you in advance ^_^","LPT: Switching college, havent done anything at current one"

LifeProTips,"Many people come in to the emergency room with symptoms they’ve had a while and have been putting it off or minor symptoms -this is nothing new, many people treat the ED like an urgent care or their primary care physician. If you’re using the ED in this sense, try to go early in the morning. In case you need tests or need to be admitted, hopefully many can then be done that day. In many hospitals, if you need an MRI or echocardiogram or other tests, they’re not available overnight so you end up staying either in the crowded ED for hours or you get admitted just so you can get this test (which can increase your hospital bill by a lot). 

Of course this is with the caveat that I’d it’s a true emergency go in when your symptoms occur.

LifeProTips,"1.	Always smile, be courteous and respectful, and treat people like human beings.  This is before during and after tipping. A smile will open more doors than a fist. 


2.	 Tip bigger. Not just percentage wise, but also using higher denominations when you tip.  If you leave a dollar as a loonie (or bill for Americans) or as four quarters is a) actually a good poker tell for discovering the quality of your hand, b) it encourages other tippers to tip not just the chump change but something nice. 


3.	 tip a good percentage even if you’re covering the bill. And if your not. Still toss in a good tip. 20% should be a minimum. I’m a bartender so 30% is mine.  They are working their ass off. They will remember you tho.  Even if it’s a year later at your favourite resort.  It’s what I like to quantify as a good or red flag system. You have the bad drunks which you red flag, and you’re not sure how but you remember they are trouble. Or your a good flag. You might wait longer, I’ve done this just to give the best service. They also don’t mind waiting if you have to kick out a problem. 


4.	Tip cash. They don’t have to worry about Due backs, it’s solid and real. And in a digital age it is very recognizable. 


5.	Smiling and being friendly. **Not Creepy** Just ask them how their day is going. 


6.	Be recognizable and memorable.  Be unique and yourself, but learn to stand out in the crowd. Tipping helps.   Have your unique look and rock it. Maybe a white strip in your hair, unique curls, or just being a louder than life personality. But even the quiet ones are memorable too. Don’t sell yourself short. 


7.	Wait patiently. Do *not* snap your fingers or wave money in their face. 


8.	Know what your ordering before hand. If it’s a big order, warn them, and then give a break down in beers (pints and bottles separately), Rail drinks, cocktails, and then shots. 


9.	Big tip at the beginning. But still tip decent later on. Go close to over tipping. You will get served faster. But then keep it at a good tip, but still try to be better than others.  You’re actually getting premium service, a promo shot on occasion **Never ask for one** and sometimes lower bills.  If they can’t promo, they will on occasion buy you drinks too. 


10. Be nice and smile. **Do NOT be a Dick**



Benefits of tipping. 

1.	You will wait less at bars. Exception is when they want to give you the best service. Maybe a bonus shot or two for being understanding. Maybe it won’t be the first drink. But they will want to do a shot with you too (if they are allowed).  


2.	You may have to wait a bit longer because the cook will take extra time making your meal.  It will be a thing of perfection tho.  You will actually get your meal faster, and still better. 

3.	Baristas are your friend.  They will know you and love you. Secret tip is learn the doorman’s coffee beverage of choice. A lot will **not** take bribes. But coffee, that will work. And for baristas, just ask if you can come in when your done your shift. They will understand you can’t get there earlier. 


4.	Pick up or take out. With Covid happening. Yes tip the actual drivers. They will remember you. But tipping the people at the restaurant, salon, bar, coffee shop. Whatever it is. My god, I’ve gotten either gratuities or the nicest cuts of meat or a fuckup on a drink order (coffee shops too).  


5.	 Babushkas, Italian Nonas, Mexican, African or Asian mothers. They will want to feed you if you’re nice. They will want to make sure you’re plump. Maybe not the best advice if you’re trying to look trim.  But if your nice, they will want to feed you more. 



**Lastly, always smile and be friendly. Ass holes will get served last!  If they don’t get kicked out. **",LPT: The Art of Tipping (also smile and be nice)

LifeProTips,"This will not only benefit you but drivers as well, since many can not pick up passengers in other states. 

For example, right now, an UberX from downtown Manhattan to Atlantic City is $322 and would take 2 hours and 10 minutes. 

However, an UberX to the Home Depot, in Jersey City, right across the tunnel, is $39 and an UberX from there to Atlantic City is $170, for a total of $209. The driving time, not including layover, is only 2 hours and 18 minutes. That’s a $113 savings on what would have been a $322 ride (35% discount) for a relatively minor inconvenience. 

**Bonus**: I’m a frequent JetBlue flier and get JetBlue points when I use Lyft to get to the airport. A Lyft to Newark Airport from downtown Manhattan is currently $63.
