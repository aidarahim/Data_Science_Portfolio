LifeProTips," 

There have been several posts and comments on LPT and other subreddits about salary negotiations. Many, but not all, of these posts share a MAJOR common misconception about negotiating for salary. These tips are based on scientific facts and not anecdotal evidence or an appeal to authority. I created these tips from the book Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman who wrote the book based on the research done by himself, Amos Tversky, and others. Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for the research outlined in the book.

* **Say your number first and aim high.**

The reason you should say your number first is because of a concept known as the anchoring effect. It occurs when people consider a particular value for an unknown quantity before estimating that quantity. The estimate for the unknown quantity stays close to the number that the person first considered. The first number considered is the anchor. All subsequent considerations for the unknown quantity are affected by the anchor.

So what does this mean?

For example, researchers asked a random group of people: ""Is the height of the tallest redwood more or less than 180 feet? What is your best guess about the height of the tallest redwood?""

The average result was 282 ft.

In the above set of questions the anchor is 180 ft but this still doesn't demonstrate what effect the anchor has on the average response.

When researchers changed the anchor from 180 ft to 1,200 ft the average result was 844 ft. Simply raising the anchor raised the average estimate by several magnitudes! This is why you should go first and aim high. If you do not go first then your future or current employer will be able to set their own anchor. It might be in their best interest to set a lower anchor than you would have set, thus resulting in a lower potential salary.

You may wonder, what does this have to do when dealing with experts? It has the same effect. The anchoring effect still works on people who are experts at estimating a specific figure. If researchers had asked employees of the National Redwood Forrest the same question their answers would still be higher when given a higher anchor although the effect would be reduced due to their expertise.

Be the first to set your anchor and aim high.

* **Don't aim too high.**

This one is intuitively obvious for most people, but it still needs to be said. Don't aim too high. If setting your anchor high raises the resulting salary then why not ask for millions of dollars?

An evaluation of the psychological impact (how bad it feels for your employer to pay a high salary) is relative to a neutral reference point which is sometimes referred to as an ""adaption level.""

Your current or future employer has some sense of how much they are willing to pay for the position (this is the adaption level). If you set your anchor higher than the adaption level then there is a pain response for your current or future employer when considering the anchor. The higher you set your anchor, the greater the pain your current or future employer feels when considering if they would be willing to pay this value. If the value is too high or ridiculous they won't consider it at all. So do your research to determine your anchor.",LPT: A few tips to negotiate salary according to SCIENCE BASED EVIDENCE

ALWAYS eat breakfast - kick starts your metabolism and helps burn more energy 


Drink loads of water - because staying hydrated is important. But also, if you feel you might be hungry - chug a pint of water. If you don't feel hungry any more then you were just bored. If you are still hungry, snack on a apple or something


Eat 5 meals, not 3 - ikr, sounds epic. You can eat the same number of calories but spread over 5 meals instead of 3 larger ones. Spread them as evenly as you can time-wise and you might find you're less hungry at the next mealtime. If that's the case, lower the calories on meal 2 or 4, keep the ""main"" meals the same


Up your movement - simple stuff like taking the stairs or taking a slightly longer route to get somewhere makes a lot more of a difference than you might realise. Make a point of going for a 5/10 minute walk when you can, a breath of fresh air and a spritely walk will make you feel more energised than a can of coke or a coffee. Even a quick walk around the house or room a few times (in these quarantined times) will do the trick


Replace sugary snacks with protein or fruit - a handful of peanuts or cashews will fill you up more than a chocolate bar, give you more energy and is much healthier


Be kind to yourself - nobody is perfect and does everything right all the time. As long as you can avoid binges or super calorie-heavy stuff then you're doing grand!

Please add other stuff you think might be handy for people!

An elite athlete wouldn’t roll out of bed and expect to perform at their peak. They warm up. They get into the right state.

So, why treat your todo list as if anything is possible, at any time?

I organize my todos by seven mental states:

* Prioritize: Planning, organizing, and – of course – prioritizing.
* Explore: Collecting information in a non-goal-oriented way.
* Research: Collecting information in a goal-oriented way.
* Generate: Using my best creative energy to create something (for me, writing).
* Polish: Refining or putting the finishing touches on something.
* Administrate: Taking care of pesky details.
* Recharge: Resting and relaxing (I don’t put these on my todo list, but maybe I should)

I use Todoist to apply each of these mental states as a tag. It’s actually very intuitive to me which mental state is right for a task!

After using these mental states for years, I now have a predictable rhythm throughout my week. I have a very good idea what times and days are best-suited for which mental states. For example, I do Administrate tasks on Friday afternoons, when my creative energy is all tapped out.

LifeProTips,"This LPT comes with a bonus Fun Fact: The vast majority of ""spam"" emails you receive to a corporate email address are actually intended, company-issued tests. Think Secret Shoppers, but for IT Security. 

Did you get a spam email to your company address, click a link without thinking, and then just considered yourself lucky when your computer didn't spontaneously explode and your credit card bill didn't quadruple? 

The spam filters being used at the enterprise level these days are **very** good. It's not that *nothing* gets through, it's just that it's very rare--and a wide attack is usually flagged and removed after only a small handful of users see it. 

What's *not rare at all* is your company hiring an outside IT security auditing service to intentionally spam their own employees and record their responses. In most cases, they'll grade you into three broad categories (that definitely don't use these names):

**Terrible:** Actually clicked on a link in a spam email

**Normal:** Didn't click on a link, deleted the email

**Best:** Didn't click on a link, reported the email to IT

Most companies running these tests will already have a Spam/Phishing reporting structure in place; a plug-in built into Outlook, a specific email to forward them to, etc. If not, just report it to your usual IT Service Desk email. They probably explained what you're supposed to do in those terrible IT Security courses they make you take every year (and that you mindlessly click through), and they usually do these sort of spam tests shortly after those required training dates. 

It's up to each company to interpret these results--generally speaking, deleting the email without a report isn't held against you, but they **really** want to see a certain percentage reporting them using the intended tools. That's because the *actually* dangerous spam are the ones that somehow make it past the email security precautions (in particular, when an actual employee gets infected and is sending malicious emails from an internal address) and at that point they're reliant upon user reports to catch it before it gets out of control. 

If they don't see a number of reports that pleases them, your team (or whole company) is likely in for additional IT Security training, and nobody wants that. Moreover, if Debra in HR keeps clicking on spam links every test cycle, they're probably going to get rid of her. 

So while they don't necessarily expect *everyone* to report these to IT, you'll potentially help keep your team out of some incredibly boring training by following the procedures in place, and possibly earn yourself some brownie points.",LPT: Always report spam/phishing emails you receive at work

LifeProTips,"This has worked for me on my last three jobs (one of them was a promotion) that I got. When the interviewer asks the question: what salary are you looking for?, instead of listing what you’re expecting ask them instead. 

I always start with explaining that I have been researching salaries in my field but wanted to know what they felt is a competitive salary for someone with my experience? (If this your first job interview or you’re going for an entry level job that you don’t have experience in, you can always change the part about experience to “this position”). 

Oftentimes, they will give you the number that they are expecting to pay for that position; and every time I ask a potential employer it has been at least $5-$10k more then I was going to ever say. 

This also helps you compare what they’re willing to pay vs whether that salary is worth the job. AND you don’t run the risk of under selling yourself!

or Rollback RX Home

Here's a video taken a few years back. (software looks much better now IMO)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ChIVSpqwA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ChIVSpqwA)

[Downloads here](https://horizondatasys.com/rollback-rx-time-machine/rollback-rx-professional/)

After you install this program

***There is almost nothing you can do to the computer software wise to mess it up.***

&amp;#x200B;

Why use this? Rollback RX takes a snapshot of your computer as it is. Your files, your registry keys..everything. Then it shoves that backup somewhere in the computer you will never see it.If you are on the free version you have 5 snapshots of your computer.

This means 5 times your computer was ''Frozen'' in state that you can use to restore it at any time.

The Professional version periodically takes snapshots of your computer.Now after you install this program Open RollbackRX and click Snapshot. Then Right click it and click Lock. You are done! The only thing you will ever notice is when your computer starts you will see a new screen that says Rollback RX ..Press Home to restore.

You will not see any changes to your computer and won't think about this program again..unless you need it.

In the background RollbackRX is taking ''Snapshots'' of your computer, deleting old ones (this is why you want to lock the first one) This happens without you ever needing to lift a finger.

However one day if you get a virus, Windows update borks your computer or something happens that prevents it from starting up.. (worms, viruses, malware, even if it gets ransomware)all you need to do is *restart your computer and tap the Home key* on your keyboard.

Got a virus? reboot and tap home key.  Pick a snapshot and click Restore. Rollback Restore will show a loading bar and in about 3 mins your computer will boot back exactly how it was when that snapshot was taken.

It doesn't matter what happened to the computer as long as it is software.This program makes repairing a computer SUPER easy, because all you need to do is press Home when it's restarting and you are good to go. 

As it restarts you will always get a friendly screen telling you you can press home to restore it.

&amp;#x200B;

You can also explore snapshots.

This means if you were working on a paper and the power went out you can check Snapshots by opening the app ''Rollback Restore'' in the main window you will see the option for Snapshots followed by a list of when the software took them. You can click on one, right click then click Explore.

Your computer will then load that snapshot of your computer..like a hard drive, which you can then open up and copy lost files. Power went out while you were writing a document? Photos from a camera get corrupted because you Cut them instead of Copied them? explore the drive.

&amp;#x200B;

This program is the biggest help I have ever run across in remote work.

It's a easy install then you **never need to worry about your computer getting viruses** again.

Pro tip: run a malware bytes scan BEFORE you install [Rollback Restore Professional](https://horizondatasys.com/rollback-rx-time-machine/rollback-rx-professional/) ..otherwise then ya locking in the viruses forever!

So there has to be a catch right?

There is, you see RebootRx comes in a few flavors and it's up to you to choose which one

Reboot Restore RX is NOT you want. This program is designed for areas like a public library where a computer is always the same without any changes. Installing this computer means EVERY time you reboot your computer it snaps back to what you froze it as. In other words you can't save anything on this computer! every time it reboots it's the computer you locked it to. Not wanted for most people.

&amp;#x200B;

RollBack Rx Server Edition

You don't want this. it's for servers.

Choose from

[Rollback RX home or Rollback RX Pro](https://horizondatasys.com/rollback-rx-time-machine/rollback-rx-professional/)

&amp;#x200B;

Home is locked to 7 snapshots. This means one Locked snapshot and 6 recurring snapshots made throughout computer usage. Assuming you **LOCK THE FIRST ONE** you have 5 times the computer will freeze a snapshot which you can use to restore the computer. For many people this might be enough, however if you are using the computer for business

it's well worth getting the Pro version. This edition will not only lock snapshots at no limit, it also supports multiple drives. This means dual operating systems can be protected or simply multiple hard drives.

This software beings enterprise level restore tools to the average home user.**Home is free = No cost.** (6 SNAPSHOTS lock the first one one)

Single License is  $69.00 (License means computer, can be installed on one computer)

RollBack Rx Pro - 3 License Pack $155 (can be installed on 3 computers)

RollBack Rx Pro - 5 License Pack $249.00  (can be installed on 3 computers)

The License options are for more computers, might be useful if you own a business and don't want to spend hundreds restoring them in the event of a malware.

you do not need Gold Support or maintenance literately all you will be doing is restarting the computer and pressing the home button.

CD Media Pack means you get a CD with your product key. Up to you if this is worth getting, the product key is sent via email and you can easily save it, but some folks might want a physical CD to hold.

Again after you set this up you never have to worry about the computer messing up again. Just reboot it and press Home.

If you fail then it was working only because it was convenient at the time but when that flood of chaos comes, what ever doesn't work is washed away and you're left with things that are strong/solid.

After a flood (a breakdown/an existential crisis), the challenge isn't to put your life back together again (how you had it before), otherwise when a flood comes it's gonna fall apart again. You proved that whatever you were doing wasn't working. 

Put it back in a more efficient way with the knowledge you learned from the flood of chaos.

LifeProTips,"So about 8 years ago my boss (at the time) always used to tell me ""don't bring me problems, bring me solutions!"" - this stuck with me.

I took it on board and began pairing up business problems with solutions. It worked, he always had time for me and in most cases, my solutions were approved and actioned. I started to realise that this approach was a surefire way to get recognition in a business and continued to pair problems and solutions before approaching him. Even if my solutions weren't the right ones, it got the ball rolling on what might be the best way to proceed. I had done the legwork and that's what mattered. 

At that same job, I worked in the same office as a couple of general office admin staff. They were miserable people. They used to drive me crazy complaining. The thing is, they had some genuine issues they needed to resolve in their area of the business. But they would always go to the boss with *just* the problem and no solution. After a while, my boss would begin to avoid them unless it was a serious matter which he himself had to solve. 

I sat and watched these administrators for a couple of years doing the same things and getting nowhere in the business. During that time I received a surprisingly sizeable pay rise. They both knew about it because they processed financial paperwork. They would make negative remarks about how they hadn't had a payrise in years. I never really engaged with it because they weren't looking for help, they wanted to complain. If I took the bait I would end up falling out with them. Not ideal if you work within 6 feet of somebody...

I left that place due to other reasons but always remembered what my boss told me. I told the admin staff on the day I left that they should be actively finding solutions before talking to the head honcho. One of them was immediately offended and the other took it on board. 
The one who was offended was asked to leave the company 6 months after my departure and the other took on loads of extra responsibility and became much happier and more successful.

I use this method all the time in both work and my home life and its a highly successful way to get people to move forwards with things. It shows proactivity and enthusiasm - two traits most directors and managers will warm to. 

TL;DR if you keep approaching your boss with a problem and a solution together, you'll gain more recognition and maybe even a promotion",LPT: pairing solutions to problems will get you recognition and promotions

LifeProTips,"So many people have anxiety about making noise complaints at a hotel. Any decent  front desk agent genuinely wants you to have a good stay, and would never consider a call complaining about noise annoying.

 Most hotels have noise policies in place to make sure everyone gets some sleep. The thing is, the noise staff hears in the hallways or outside the rooms is often much quieter than what guests hear through the neighboring walls. Depending on the property layout and staffing, the overnight staff may not even be aware that there are potential noise problems unless they are alerted to it. More times than not, a quick call to the offending parties room will solve the problem. 

In the case of major parties, an eviction might be necessary. Keep in mind that most cities require that at least one warning be given to guests before any evictions can take place. Waiting until 1AM to alert staff may mean that you will spend your whole night sleepless. (The longer people have been drinking, the harder it is to evict quickly). Better to let the front desk know as soon as the noise becomes a problem.

LifeProTips,"Ever since the pandemic my 401K has taken a 20% hit, but I don't really care much about it. The 20% hit is pretty much from the free money my employer has contributed. I put 6% and they match another 4.5% at a 100% rate, so in reality 10.5% of my salary goes into 401K. Even if I take a 40% hit, I'm not worried, it's part of the employers contribution that is lost. Now if it goes lower than that, then yes I'd be worried lol. Yes, I know it would hurt my compounding interests in the short-term, but I'm young enough to hope I gain back that 20% hit in the next 20yrs. 

Example: Let's say my 6% contribution is equal to $100, that means my employer's match equals to $45. So if I take a 20% hit on my 401K, I'm still up $16 because my balance would be $116 (20% of $145). So essentially I have not really lost any money I put into my retirement.

I tried playing basketball and started doing cycling classes. It was amazing I met some great friends. I started eating healthier. I did everything I could to take my mind off it.
