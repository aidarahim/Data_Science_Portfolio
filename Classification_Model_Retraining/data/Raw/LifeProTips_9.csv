LifeProTips,"For those of you still fine-tuning your adulting, here are a couple cleaning tricks. (Thanks mom)

1. If you're dusting or wiping surfaces stuff will end up on the floor. So do your thing, starting with dusting in the higher places and work your way downwards ending your cleaning routine with sweeping/vacuuming/washing the floors last.


2. Keep separate sets of cloths/rags for use in different areas in the home to help reduce cross-contamination. Eg Don't use dish cloths to wipe surfaces in the bathroom. Don't use hand towels on the floor, etc. If a towel or rag has been demoted to use on the floor, don't use it on a countertop again until it's been through the wash.


3. Wash cleaning cloths/rags separate from bath, hand and face towels. Wash both bundles on high heat with a disinfectant detergent. 


4. If you're a guy who's ever cleaned your own toilet, you'll know that sitting down to pee helps make the life of whoever's cleaning your toilet a little less bleak.","LPT when cleaning your home: Work from top downwars, keep separate sets of cloths, dusters and towels for separate cleaning purposes.

LifeProTips,"There's a quick trip to getting the right pronoun if you're unsure: just try it on its own in a sentence without the other parties.

 For example:

""Her and her mom drove to the house""
Say it without the mom and it sounds like this:

""Her drove to the house""
That sounds like someone imitating a cave man.

Try the other female pronoun instead
""She drove to the house.""
That sounds better.

""She and her mom drove to the house""


Another example:
""Me and her took pictures""
Try it with just me: ""me took pictures""
Cave man!
Try it with just her:
""Her took pictures""
Cave woman!

Try the other pronouns: she and I.
""She and I took pictures""

One more example
""He took a picture of her and I""

Ok break it down
""He took a picture""
Ok no problem..
""He took a picture of her""
Still good...
""He took a picture of I""
This time the cave man was hiding at the end. Try the other first person pronoun:
""He took a picture of me""
""He took a picture of her and me""

If you’re afraid of having to delete your history browser or stay in a place where porn might be restricted, create a second Reddit account dedicated to your porn tastes.

The porn reddit account holds no browser history as all the porn you like is on your home page depending on what you subscribe to, you are also able to save posts that you wish to return to later on your account. The fact that they’re two separate accounts also means that no one can trace all the porn back to you regardless of how much investigation they do.

My personal favorite quirk to this life hack is that you can switch back to your “innocent” account when your deeds in the dark side are finished and no one is likely to ever take your phone and check whether you have two accounts.

LifeProTips,"Hi folks,

So this is actually something I've been doing for years but started taking more seriously recently - with good effect.

I'm quite a heavy coffee drinker and used to occasionally drink a beer whenever I was a little too ""stimulated"" to get to sleep. Unfortunately I developed post-surgical gastritis over the past six months so have basically had to quit drinking 100%. I needed a solution (other than not drinking coffee of course!) ... and I'm hopeful that this is it!

Basically I have come to understand how much total darkness, while a little unnerving at first, is very effective at inducing sleep. For me it takes about 20 to 30 minutes and I listen to a podcast while the drowsiness sets in.

However, I've found that the room has to be *really* dark for the magic to properly work. So in order to make sure that my bedroom doesn't have even a glimmer of light, I:

* **Covered up every device with an LED light in the room with black insulation tape.** I have one of those USB charging stations and that was the first ""offender"" I found. But I came across a few more.
* **Installed blackout curtains**
* Bought a good eye mask. [The Manta mask](https://mantasleep.com/) is still on my wish list, but for now I'm happy with one for about half the price.

That's basically it. Simply by making my room incredibly dark I can manage to get to sleep when, six months ago, I would have been sure that it would be impossible. A podcast is also a nice way to end the day. Although inevitably I don't end up remembering much from what I listen to what I'm drifting off.",LPT: Cover LED lights with insulation tape and sleep in total darkness

I was so hooked on I started to buy WW2 books and read them. Now I am pretty well educated about WW1, WW2 and many other military conflicts around the globe.

I also played Rome: Total War. I learned about many different factions, tribes and states during ancient Rome times and their relations. But only because I wanted to know so I googled stuff.

Another great educational game is ARK: Survival, it is full of dinosaurs and obviously there is so much to learn. Now I know that T-Rex could never meet Stegosaurus, cause they lived in different periods.

I am currently playing Elite Dangerous (space exploring simulator, NASA helped with development) and I am slowly learning about our Milky Way, biggest stars known to men, what we can see with a naked eye and many other interesting things.

1. Download [youtube-dl.exe](https://youtube-dl.org/) in your Downloads folder.
2. Download [ffmpeg.exe](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/), unzip it, and copy ffmpeg.exe from the ""bin"" folder into the same folder as step 1.

4. Enter `youtube-dl https://v.redd.it/p8fg5d51fy651` or whatever reddit video you want.
5. Enjoy your favorite kitten videos anytime!

--------------

#Youtube-dl

Why wait hours for some reddit bot that links you to some sketchy site just to download that cute kitten video? Do it yourself instantly!

[youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) is free, open-source software that lets you download videos on hundreds of sites inclucing reddit, YouTube, an so many others. Here's a full list of [supported sites](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html).

Youtube-dl can even download just the audio from videos (or extract it afterward) and convert it directly to MP3, AAC, or whatever you prefer. ([FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) is sometimes required, another free, open-source program.) If you're feeling really fancy, it can download audio, convert to MP3, then run a command to send it to your Android phone's music folder all at once. It's very powerful.

It's a command line program, but there are also GUIs you can download, if you prefer. [Here's one](https://mrs0m30n3.github.io/youtube-dl-gui/). That one even comes with its own copy of FFMPEG, and it automatically downloads the latest version of youtube-dl.exe. You could skip the rest of this post and just use that.

Youtube-dl will resume downloads where it left off in case you lost your internet or closed the command window by accident, or if you need to shutdown or reboot. You can press Ctrl-C to terminate the program and then run the same command later to resume it. Or just close the command window.

It can download entire YouTube channels or playlists. You can download your favorite music playlists to MP3s with a single command.

It won't waste time re-downloading videos into the same folder if you already have them. Plus, you can use a certain command to remember which YouTube videos it's already downloaded (by saving their IDs in a plain text file), so you can download every new video on your favorite channel, watch them at your leisure, then delete them to save space, and it won't re-download them again later. You can run that same command anytime you want to check for new videos and it will download just the new ones. (I don't explain how to do this in this tutorial.)

You can download the highest quality 1080p or 4k videos even if your bandwidth isn't good enough to support streaming them.

#How to Install

The EXE you download is the program itself. There is no installer. Here are some instructions.

##The simple way:

1. Keep youtube-dl.exe in your Downloads folder. 
2. Open a command line in your Downloads folder to use it.

##The advanced way:

To make it easier to use in Windows, you could put it in a folder that's linked in the Windows PATH variable, so that you can run the program from *any* folder. So that's what the following instructions do.

1. **Create a folder** anywhere on your computer to hold programs like this. Call it ""Programs"". Maybe put it in the root of your user folder. E.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Programs`. Obviously, ""YourName"" will be whatever your user name is. Do **not** save it to your ""Program Files"" folder or ""Program Files (x86)"".
2. Open the **System Properties** window to the **Advanced** tab. There are several ways to do this. Here are two:
    * Hold the **Windows key and press Pause/Break** to open the **System Information** window then click on ""**Advanced System Settings**"" on the left. This is what I do because it's the fastest.
    * Open the Start Menu and type ""Advanced system"" and click on ""View advanced systems settings"" in the search results.
3. In the **System Properties** window that opened, make sure the **Advanced tab** is selected then click the ""**Environment Variables...**"" button at the bottom.
3. In the window that opens, double click on the **Path** variable in the upper box labled ""User variables for YourName"". This will open the Windows path editor. (In Windows 10 it's finally a nice editor. In older versions you have to manually enter entries seprated with a semicolon `;`.)
4. Click the ""New"" button to add a new Path entry. Paste in the full path to whatever folder you created in step 1. E.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Programs`. And hit OK. 
5. You can now open a command line in *any* folder to use youtube-dl.exe and download videos into that folder.
    * Just a note: changing your Path variable only affects newly opened command windows. Ones you already had opened won't see this new path.
    
#FFMPEG

[FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) is a free, open-source command line video editor and converter. It's pretty amazing in its own right, and can do many video editing tasks. Some websites that stream video use what's called DASH video which sends you separate audio and video streams that need to be combined into a final video. Youtube-dl uses FFMPEG to do this. If you don't install it, youtube-dl will only download 720 videos from YouTube at most, and it won't be able to make MP3s, etc.

You can download Windows builds of FFMPEG directly from here: https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/

##Two ways to install it:

One, keep the whole folder with all three FFMPEG programs and such:

1. Create a folder named ""ffmpeg"" in the Programs folder you made above. E.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Programs\ffmpeg`
2. Download the current version from the above link into that folder and unzip it there.
3. Add the path to the bin folder in your Path environment variable like described in the advanced instructions above. E.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Programs\ffmpeg\bin`

Two, just keep the ffmpeg.exe.

1. Unzip the download and and copy just ffmpeg.exe from the ""bin"" folder into the same folder as youtube-dl.exe and throw away the rest of the files.
    
#How to use youtube-dl.exe

1. Open a command line to the folder where you want to save the video. If you used the Simple Install instructions, this is your Downloads folder.
    * To open a command line to a specific folder, the easiest method is to go find that folder in Windows Explorer, hold down Shift, right-click the Folder, and click ""Open Command window here"". This option only appears when Shift is held down by default. (You can change that behavior in the Registry, but that's a separate topic.)
2. Invoke `youtube-dl` with the URL to the video as the only argument.

That's it!

##Escaping special characters

If the URL contains a `?` or a `&amp;`, you have to escape them by putting a `^` in front of them. If you're only downloading a single video from YouTube itself, you only need the video ID, anyway, so don't even bother with the full URL; just take the video ID after the `v=` but not including any `&amp;`. If you are downloading an entire playlist, though, you will need the full URL and must escape these characters.

E.g.: consider the following playlist URL: 

`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qyclqo_AV2M&amp;list=PLmo4pBukfRoN8SB5RKvfiY9CTl9pI_IFc`

You would need to do:

`youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch^?v=Qyclqo_AV2M^&amp;list=PLmo4pBukfRoN8SB5RKvfiY9CTl9pI_IFc` (Notice the two `^` characters.)

But if you just want the one video, you only need: 

Or just: `youtube-dl Qyclqo_AV2M`

If you are just using the video ID,  but the video ID starts with a dash `-`, then this will confuse the command and you need to enter a double dash `--` before the ID to indicate that options are over and the rest of the command line is positional arguments. 

E.g., if the URL is `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xxxxxxxxxxx`, then you you use:

`youtube-dl -- -xxxxxxxxxxx`

Otherwise it will think that `-xxxxxxxxxxx` is an option and not the video ID. I mention this because as you get into the habit of downloading YouTube videos this way, it's not uncommon to encounter this, get errors, and not know how to proceed.

**Note:** You don't need to escape the `?` or `&amp;` in the GUI program. In fact, it will cause an error if you do.

#Updates

You can run the command `youtube-dl -U` and it will update the exe right over itself! YouTube routinely has updates that break it, so if it ever doesn't work, just update it and try again. If it still doesn't work because there was no update available, wait a day. It gets updated very quickly.

#Android

You can run the Linux version in a command line like Termux and download videos and audio on the go! It's even possible with Termux to setup a script that acts as a URL handler, so you just ""Share"" on a video page or YouTube video, choose Termux, and it will pass the URL to youtube-dl using that script. If there's interest, I will try to find the instructions I used to set this up on my own phone. That was here on reddit, too.

I can't find the exact one I followed, but here's a google search that links to a few to get you started: https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areddit.com+youtube-dl+android+termux",LPT: It's super easy to download reddit videos yourself using youtube-dl.exe.

Carefully pick up the rug (don't roll it because you'll just transfer a bunch of dirt from the dirty side to the clean side.) Sweep up all the dust that has fallen out of the rug, then lay the rug right-side-up and vacuum the top again. For very dirty rugs you might have to repeat a few times.

LifeProTips,"Long post alert. My grandfathers on either side died within a year, 10 years ago, and my grandmothers are living alone for most of the time. Many times when their children (my parents, aunts and uncles) gather around, I feel that they reminisce more about their father/father-in-law than actually asking how their mother/mother-in-law is doing. I am not saying that they must ignore their father/FIL once he's dead, but they should check on their mother more than they talk about the father. My parents and uncles/aunts love thier mother but they don't remember to call her due to thier ""busy"" lives. An year ago, when I asked how my grandma was doing and if she needed help in anything, her eyes went misty. Hardly anyone bothered about her needs and wellbeing. I helped setting up her phone and tablet. Now she knows how to video call and sometimes calls me too. I regularly check on her and bring her things that would make her little busy. I showed some gardening channels on YouTube and she started a herb garden all on her own.

Also on another side note, single grand parents are vulnerable to most of the door-to-door marketing executives. My grandma had subscriptions to many online magazines and she hardly knew how to use her email/smartphone.  They might've signed up for many things they may not even need/know. So whenever you visit them, check their accounts and if you see random subscriptions, ask them if they really want them. If they don't, you can cancel them easily as you can call out on marketing BS. Saves many single grandparents a ton load of money",LPT: Care more about the living than you reminisce the dead.

LifeProTips," When i started painting it took me 2  years before i showed anyone my work. And when I did, I introduced it as  'shit'. Despite praises from close friends i just couldn't believe that  my paintings were any good because I couldn't put what was in my head  on canvas. The outcome never met my expectations of what i thought was  'good'. Only when i realized a few years down the road that being able to put exactly what was in my head onto canvas IS 'mastery'. That's what the end goal is and it takes work. A LOT of work to get there. 

I  had to throw my expectations out the window and just work. Then after i  was done with a piece i had to objectively see it for what it was with fresh eyes, not what i expected it to be. If I dont like it, I fix it until i do. Most artist hold themselves to the highest of expectations and will be the toughest critic on themselves.

This is why most stop painting. I had to adopt the thinking of 'accept the positive and ignore  the negative.'

LifeProTips,"**TL;DR** Many car insurance adjusters' systems use a geographical search radius for specific types of cars. If you have a lesser popular/known car, you might benefit by expanding the search radius to include more comparisons. 

Late last year, I was involved in an accident, caused by someone, else that ended up totaling my car--a decade old Hyundai. They were at fault and luckily they had insurance that agreed to pay for damaged.

I chatted with the adjuster for a little and stood nearby while he did his thing. He then informed me the car would be considered totaled and then provided me the amount they would pay.

Having done my research on the value of the car, their number seemed WAY off--like $1500 off.

I asked out him how many cars his system was comparing to. He said six. That's terribly low. I then asked him if he could expand the search radius further because comparing to 6 cars only doesn't make sense.

He did and the number of cars when up considerably, as did the value--about $1300 more.

I agreed on this amount and they hauled the car away shortly after.

LifeProTips,"If you want to run more, don't tell anyone. Figure out a simple sustainable workout routine and stick to it.

If you want to eat less, don't tell anyone. Figure out a simple sustainable diet and stick to it.

The science speaks for itself. Telling people too early can give you a premature sense of success [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19389130/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19389130/). Small changes are also far more sustainable. I don't necessarily agree with the details of these talks, but the big-picture message about sustainability is consistent: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8),  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\_continue=167&amp;v=UNP03fDSj1U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=167&amp;v=UNP03fDSj1U) 

There are other benefits too. For example:

\-If you want to help your spouse around the house more, don't tell them you want to help, just do it.

\-If you want to be kinder to your friends, don't tell anyone, just do it.

If you don't tell anyone your intentions then there's no expectation that you will follow through. Changing habits are hard, and it's not a fast process either. But if you are successful at sustaining some change, it's extremely satisfying when someone takes notice. It's a genuine indicator of improvement as opposed to someone trying to blow smoke up your ass.

As a final note, I leave you with my favorite quote of all time:

&gt;Every day it gets a little easier… But you gotta do it every day — that’s the hard part. But it does get easier

LifeProTips,"This is something that I did early this year that I still regret doing to this day.

I used to have a group of friends that lasted for 7 years, and inside this group there was my former best friend, who we met in 6th grade and became friends in 7th grade out of my stupidity of throwing an eraser on someone's head.

We were super close friends throughout and after high school. We went through a lot together. We got hurt, we fought, we laughed, we came out to each other. 

He jokingly used to say many times that he'd date me and that he had fantasies of sleeping with me, and I never took these things seriously. I was never into him that way, and still am not. I never took these things seriously. Not until around January.

For some reason, after reading countless Reddit love stories and other stories in other platforms (and even news platforms!), I saw that a lot of people had these ""we were best friends before"" stories and how your future partner is supposedly your best friend and although I've never had true feelings for friends of mine, I thought it was a great idea to trick him to calling him cute and want him to maybe be his gf.

Horrible idea.

He accepted the idea, and once he said he liked it, I instantly regretted saying what I said. Hours later in the same day I did the take confession, I told him I was out of my mind and told him to forget what I said. He said he was cool with that.

Maybe he was, maybe he wasn't and didn't confess his real feelings to me.

We talked to each other some more. He stopped talking to me weeks later. I sent messages to him in many platforms, yet he didn't even bother reading them. That's when I knew I fucked up and lost my best friend out of my own stupidity. 

That's why I advise anyone wondering if they should date a friend of theirs because that's apparently how good relationships begin, I tell them to not do that. It's perfectly ok to just have friends of the same or opposite sex and not want to fuck or love them, especially if you're not the type to get romantically attached to one as I am. 

Date someone outside your circle of friends so at least you don't ruin your existent friendships, and if you end up dating a friend, make sure your feelings are real and mutual. Don't fall for romanticism and ""the normal.""",LPT: Don't Fake Feelings for Your Best Friend Because of Love Stories

However if you use a nickname, and never even mention your birth name, to your friends online or in public, they really have no way to reverse search it because they don’t know it.

LifeProTips,"Often, when my mind is racing and I can't sleep, I focus on just moving my finger to a pattern. My pattern of choice is the paraddidle: Left Right Left Left, Right Left Right Right; LRLL, RLRR... And so on. 

Focus on keeping the tempo steady and lento more than anything. The movements needn't be big; rather, I find it most effective when I'm barely moving my finger at all.

Soon enough, you'll find yourself not moving your finger and the LRLL, RLRR will be happening in your head only. When you notice this, start moving your finger to the pattern again. Otherwise it becomes too easy for your mind to drift.

When your mind does drift (which it will), don't get annoyed that it happened or aggravated that your mind is still racing. Instead, appreciate the thought for what it is and let it go. Trying to suppress it will not let it fade away but will instead push it down, only for the thought - and others - to fight harder to get through.

If you get a hospital bill you cannot pay, contact the hospital ASAP and ask to speak to a financial services staff member to inquire about applying for their charity care program. You’ll usually need the following:

Proof of income/unemployment (pay stub, bank deposit information)
Copy of your last Federal and State tax returns
Household info (how many people in your household and their ages)
Statement of your inability to pay

You might need additional information, like a copy of your lease or mortgage information, utility bills, and the like. 

Follow the application you receive precisely, and keep a copy for yourself. 

Many programs offer graduated relief, often up to 400% of poverty level income. For a family of 4 in the USA, that is $104,800. So - don’t think “I make too much to qualify” - you might not, and if you’re currently unemployed, including that information may influence your application. 

Another bonus: some hospitals may suspend collections on accounts once you apply for charity care. Even if you get denied, it will at least give you extra time to pay. 

Do not “just pay a little” every month in the hopes that you will avoid collections. That strategy doesn’t work, but working WITH the hospital and taking advantage of their programs certainly can!

And - not only did I work in the system, I just used to my benefit. I had surgery in March and was furloughed from my job in April. Just got notified my ENTIRE remaining balance was paid off by this sort of program!","LPT: Many US hospitals have charity care programs, discounting your bill by up to 100%!"

LifeProTips,"With the ever popular LPT [resurfacing](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/hs5tmv/lpt_if_you_have_to_put_down_your_animal_be_with/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) about being there for your pets in their final moment, I wanted to share my experience with COVID and the loss of a pet. I wish I had known this sooner.

When my good girl and family cat of 20 years passed this month, it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. We knew she wouldn't make it to the vet in her rapidly deteriorating state. She hated the car and the vets, and we didnt want her last moments to be of extreme duress. We also knew we couldn't go into the vet with her because of COVID. I couldn't imagine her dying alone without the only family she's ever known- even if it was with really wonderful people who really care about your fur fam and their comfort.

We opted for a housecall vet that specialized in at-home euthanasia- I believe Lap of Love has locations all over the US. She unfortunately didn't make it to the housecall appointment. I spent her last 9 hours playing relaxing music with a dim light, while gently petting that spot behind her ear that she loved. I hated that she suffered for so long. It was mind-numbing watching that suffering for so long.

The moment of death was something I was not ready for. She took her last bit of energy to turn and look at me before succumbing. I will never forget that look. She was always there and always knew when I was sick, and I absolutely was not going to leave her side this time. It was an incredibly tender moment we shared.

ESPECIALLY during COVID when a lot of vets understandably aren't allowing people in with their pets, there are many organizations that specialize in at-home euthanasia. Please be there for the ones that have always been there for you, if you can. I don't want to shame those who aren't able to, because it IS incredibly difficult. I wish I had known this LPT and made the housecall appointment sooner to limit her suffering. We like to think our pets die peacefully in their sleep- they don't. The night before she passed, she fought so hard to eat even the tiniest bit of food before throwing it up. They are built for survival, and their death is usually a slow, painful process when done ""naturally"".

The organization I worked with was amazing, even though they never made it out. They sent the most heartfelt email when I let them know she had passed and I would be cancelling the appointment, even though they ended up not being paid a dime to be so kind. The email subject for her appointment confirmation was ""How lucky am I to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard?"" That quote broke me. How lucky am I?

RIP, my [sweet girl](https://imgur.com/gallery/9IyCHpD). I'll love you forever.","LPT: YSK that there are many organizations that specialize in at-home euthanasia for your loved fur fam, especially during COVID."

LifeProTips,"Around 100 yoghurt caps equal 1 litre of diesel (~2300 per gallon)

That means if you eat a yoghurt a day, over 10 years you throw around 6 litres of diesel STRAIGHT INTO THE TRASH. And that's ONLY the amount of ELECTRICAL energy needed to make aluminium, not including mining or any other form of energy required.

Assuming you throw single serving yoghurt aluminium foil caps into the trash instead of recycling, and assuming all that aluminium has to be produced from new sources (e.g. not recycling - that requires a SHITTON of energy); and assuming the energy comes from oil;

Primary aluminum production (so not recycled) costs around 15kWh/kg (google)

You can produce around 4 kWh of power from a litre of diesel with power plants. (~40% efficiency, rest is thermodynamics)

A yoghurt foil top weighs around 0.42 grams (measured myself)

Regardless, the nature of this post isn't to sway you in any direction, but to instead break you free from anything that's holding you back in life. 

About Me:

I’m a military veteran who has struggled with anxiety, depression, insomnia, and adhd. I have tried various types of medication but disliked the various side-effects. I have found a method that works for me, and I hope for you, the same.

Many look for a key, item, person, or thing to make themselves happy. This is impossible because happiness is purely subjective, and one person’s happiness may differ from another person’s. This is a no-nonsense guide on how to find your own happiness, but as happiness is subjective, you will find you are not finding happiness, but creating happiness from within.

Perfection is impossible, this is a never ending process, so please be patient and give it at least 30 days before dismissing these suggestions entirely. Again, this is all subjective, you get to choose what you get out of these exercises.

Required Materials:

    Journal – I recommend the bullet journal method, but any will do
    
    Writing utensil – for your journal
    
    Proper Mindset – this will be cultivated over time

Before Starting:

    I highly recommend--I can not stress this enough--a proper sleep, yoga, and meditation routine. I will delve deeper into all three further in the reading.

Journaling:

    You will reflect on everything that you do during the day, from eating, to talking with friends. Write down everything you can, only writing down positive information. For example: “I drank tea today. I made sure to be mindful of every sip, tasting and smelling the fragrance of the tea. The warmth brought me a feeling of comfort. I am thankful for being able to afford such luxuries.”
    
    Remember, only write positive information in your journal. Be sure to write about everything that you can, especially the exercises in this guide.  

Power of Words:

    When you speak, your ideas are converted from thoughts to waves, and if they make it to a proper receiver, back to thoughts. When that information reaches the receiver, a metaphorical seed is planted in their brain. When you speak angry words, you are planting angry seeds in someone’s head, including your own. When you speak words of kindness and love, you will find that you can cultivate a beautiful garden.
    
    People are like mirrors, that’s why you should always treat others the way you would want to be treated. If you treat someone with kindness, they are more likely to be kind back. If you criticize or lecture someone, they will think it’s right for them to do the same back to you--no one likes to be lectured. If you make fun of someone, even in jest, you will find they will dish it right back to you, sometimes worse...
    
    When you say angry things, you will think angry things. When you think angry things, you will tend to say angry things. The same works for words of kindness and love. Try to refrain from swearing and violent thoughts and reflect in your journal whenever you catch yourself filtering your thougths. Be sure to thank yourself for your efforts using words of love and kindness.  

Sleep:

    You will find these exercises require a great deal of focus and mindfulness. Without adequate sleep, you will find these tasks to be more challenging than they should be. Many people put sleep on the bottom of their priorities, but I argue that sleep should be one of your highest priority, possibly second to food and water.
    
    Without adequate sleep, you aren’t able to think straight. Many know the feeling of being overtired, you tend to say and do things you wouldn’t do normally. It’s best to sleep at the same time everyday, but some professions do not allow for that kind of luxury. Try your best and thank yourself for your efforts.
    
    Going to bed at the same time every night will put your body into a routine. This is beneficial because you will start naturally feeling tired around bedtime. Having a night time ritual compounds this effect. For example, you may get a glass of water, use the bathroom, brush your teeth, change, and go to bed. Doing the same routine every night will prime your body for bedtime.  
    
    Ensure the bedroom is for sleep and sex only. It may be tempting to watch tv, play on your phone, etc, but you will teach your body that the bedroom is for play instead of sleep. It is also recommended you stop looking at screen at least an hour before bed, as the blue light from the screen disrupts melatonin production, your body’s natural response to absence of light, which primes you for sleep. You may find it difficult to practice these steps at first, but if you keep at it, you will find getting to sleep gets a lot easier.  

Yoga and Meditation:

    I do not want to dive too deep into explaining practices. I would advise that you take 30 minutes a day for yoga, and 30 minutes a day for meditation. Yoga teaches you how to control your body, and it releases tension in stress, making you overall more comfortable.  
    
    Yoga teaches you how to be with yourself. The best way I can describe meditation is that we often seek to escape our thoughts and ourselves, meditation makes you face yourself and find comfort within.  
    
    I recommend an illustrated yoga book as I have found better results going at my own pace as opposed to a video class. Please try both of these for 30 days. I’m begging you.

Perspective:

    A man was taking a shortcut through a field on a hot summer’s day to escape the heat. He steps in a cow pie and exclaims, “aww shit!” The fly on the cow pie says, “shit!? That was my lunch!”
    
    You can choose to be the man, or you can choose to be the fly in any situation. No, I’m not asking you to eat shit! Consider a hunter walking through the field instead. The hunter may step in the cow pie and feel excited knowing there’s food nearby! Consider a farmer, he’s probably used to stepping in pies all day long. The farmer may feel happy knowing the land is healthy and fertilized.
    
    You can feel any way you want about any situation, its all about perspective.

Zooming:

    There are more than 7 billion people on this planet, each with lives of their own. There have been billions that come before you, there will be billions that come after you. The universe has been around longer than our imaginations can truly comprehend, and it will be around even longer than that!  
    
    Our lives are just a blink of an eye in the grand scheme of things. If you look at the cosmos and zoom out, we are smaller than a grain of sand compared to everything else! If you’re upset, ask yourself, “will this matter in a year? Does this impact the grand scheme of the universe around me?” You will often find your answer is “no,” and that you were upset over nothing.

Anxiety and Depression:

    Anxiety is to worry about what’s next. Depression is to be disheartened by the past. You can’t predict the future, you can’t change the past, but you can live in the present and enjoy every moment of it. Know that you’re doing your best, the rest is up to the universe.  

Materialism and Money:

    Money is useful, I wont argue that. We have been raised to think that becoming a dragon and hoarding piles of wealth is the be-all and end-all of the world. It’s not. It’s not even close to as important as we make it out to believe. We are tricked into thinking we need to work 40hrs a week just to live, that’s ridiculous. What makes 40hrs of my time any more or less valuable than 40hrs of your time? Time is the most valuable commodity you have, you are worth more than you’ve been told. They need us more than we need them.
    
    If you had all the money you needed, and you bought whatever it was that you wanted, what would you buy next? Many do not know—I don’t know. Money is useful as an exchange for goods and services, but it does not make one happy, neither does buying everything.  
    
    Many have probably bought something to only throw it out or replace it in a short period. I’m sure buying that thing seemed like the best way to fill the emptiness in your heart, but in the end you only end up with an empty heart and an empty wallet.
    
    My advice, do what is necessary to live. If you cherish every second of your time, the happiness will come naturally. I am not saying you should live without comfort—that’s ridiculous.

The Biggest Lie:

    The biggest lies are the lies we convince ourselves into believing. The absolute biggest lie is our idea of identity. Consider an axe that has had its handle replaced. Is it the same axe? What if the head is also replaced? Each component is now different than the original, but some will still call it the same axe.
    
    Consider our bodies, comprised of little bits of matter we call “cells.” Most cells in your body get replaced regularly, so in a few years time, you will be comprised of completely new cells, yet we still consider ourselves the same. Your brain will create new pathways to memories and ideas that are used regularly and shut off pathway that are neglected. If you have brain damage, you will act like someone completely different, are you still you?
    
    We change every single moment, yet we hold on to ideas from the past. We force ourselves into these ever-narrowing roles such as computer programmer, lawyer, doctor, etc. People will bring up stories and actions from your past, confining you to those definitions, neglecting the fact that people change. If an idea no longer suits you, change it, get rid of it! They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again while expecting different results, yet we are the insane ones, stuck in the past, confining ourselves to silly labels.  
    
    If you no longer want to be a programmer, the class clown, the person who likes to play video games, etc, then stop. Simple as that. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise, no matter who they are. What made humans special in the first place was our ability to adapt.  
    
    We are not our bodies, as our bodies are forever changing. We are not what we think and feel because those are forever changing as well. We are the consequences of how we use our bodies and our minds.  

Breathing:

    Just as words can change the mind, and the mind can change the words that regularly come out of your mouth, your breath can change your mind, and your mind can change the way you breath. Anyone who has ever been jumped or scared knows that their heart rate and breathing rate will elevate, and then descend back to baseline when you calm down.  
    
    Take large, deep breaths. We tend not to use our full lung capacity. If you practice deep breathing, you will expand your capacity to breath, and realign your body. You will notice that you can’t take a full breath without proper posture. You can use your breath to correct your posture.
    
    Slowing your breathing will trick your brain into calming you down. Try it yourself. You will find this practice challenging at first, but with time and effort, you will make permanent changes. The use of a mantra is very beneficial because it stops you from thinking about other things and it creates a rhythm. I like to do the following:
    
    (breathing in)
    
    vessel, melon
    
    (breathing out)
    
    spirit, dwelling

and it looks like:

    (breathing in)
    
    ves...sel...mel...on…
    
    (breathing out)
    
    spir...it...dwel...ling…

The words begin to lose meaning, that’s when they work best. You can use anything you’d like!

Duality, Sides, Polarity:

    People get stuck on the small details when in reality they are arguing about the same thing. Take science and religion, for example. In science we are trying to find universal truth. In some religions, we declare God as the universal truth. If we crack science and find a mathematical law that runs the universe, couldn’t you just call that God? In the end you’ve achieved the same thing, right? If the universe can be described as a formula, you could argue that God is the formula, or the formula is God’s word, right?
    
    That was fun, let’s look at politics. If you ask a million people how they envision their ideal life, you will probably get a million different answers. We go overboard and look at fine-grain details like socialism vs capitalism. If you look at the big picture, everyone wants to live their life without other people infringing on their way of life. Whatever model you use, capitalism, socialism, anarchism, or something else, aims to do the same thing. I will not argue which is better, except that we are currently doing a poor job, but I will argue that people need to look at the big picture. They’re arguing about two sides of the same coin.  
    
    To reiterate, we all often want the same things, but we get too hung up on the fine details to realize we are arguing about the same idea.   

Control:

    Try this exercise: sit or lay down comfortably. Slow your breathing and use your mantra. Focus on each part of your body and then relax it. Imagine a bright ball of light above your head that is warm, comforting, brings you joy. Try to aim for pure bliss if possible. If you were successful, you may have felt—this is subjective—amazing! You may need to try other visualization techniques to achieve this effect, but I know it’s possible!
    
    With enough practice you can bring about any feeling of emotion you desire. You will find that your ability to do this strongly correlates to how much meditation and yoga you are doing. This is a useful tool that you can use anytime you’d like.
    
    Emotions are not discrete, they are a spectrum. Love and hate are on the same spectrum, but love and fear are not. You can change one emotion into another as long as they are on the same spectrum of emotion. This is tough and requires a high degree of mental fortitude. Remember, you can choose to be the fly, but don’t eat shit!
    
    You will find that even though you can shift how you feel, you may still find difficulty with negative emotions. Just like the universe around you, your emotions are in constant motion, like a wave. If a positive and negative experience meet, they neutralize. Two positive experiences will build you higher, and two negative experiences will take you lower. You can rise above a wave of emotion by remembering you are not your body or your mind, and that thoughts arise naturally without consent. You can then breath and use your mantra, calling on your positive feeling. This process mitigates how far you sway in one direction or the other. Use it well.

Before Jumping In:

    Please heed my advice, these processes work best with adequate sleep, yoga, and meditation practices. I can not stress this enough. REMEMBER TO WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN.  Be positive, if you can’t, make up a reason to be. 

Exercise 1 – Healing Water

    Before drinking water, slow your breath and say a mantra. Take a sip and hold the water in your mouth for one inhale/exhale cycle. While doing this, be thankful for that sip of water, imagine it rejuvenating and healing you. Swallow the water, and breath one more cycle.  
    
    This process will make you more mindful every time you drink and you will be able to use a sip of water as a moment to pause life, reflect, and be thankful.
    
    I find this works great with a cup of tea! Do the same as above, but don't stop the process until you finish your tea. This is a form of mindful meditation!

Exercise 2 – Thankfulness

    When you wake up, before bed, and before meals, take a pause. Slow your breath, give your thanks and gratitude, try to cultivate that feeling of bliss. This is basically praying. If you’re religious, pray to your God, if not, thank yourself, the universe, or the world around you.
    
    This process increases your feelings of gratitude and is another good way to take a pause.

Exercise 3 – Slow Eating

    We often eat too fast with distractions. Take your time. Take smaller bites, chew a certain number of times or breath for a certain number of times before swallowing each bite. Take each moment to reflect on how lucky you are to be eating, even if you’re well off, and how delicious the food is.
    
    You can also use this time to envision your body being repaired and energized by the food you’ve been eating. You will find that you can achieve any effect you desire.  

Exercise 4 – Time-based Prayer / Gratitude

    You may find it easier to take a moment of gratitude or prayer at certain times of the day. You could adapt a process similar to various religious traditions.  

Exercise 5 – A Higher Power

    Religious or not, this technique is incredibly effective. If you were to imagine that every single act you did was for a divine being, you will tend to practice mindfulness with ease. Do not mistake acting for a divine being as being directed or judged by a divine being. Think along the lines of paying tribute to the divine.
    
    This works best if you create a small list of virtues, think similar to the 10 commandments, but adapted for your needs. The more rules you have, the more rules that can be broken, and the harder it is to keep track of them. Try to be short and concise with little room for interpretation.

Exercise 6 – Sign from Divine

    This goes in hand with exercise 5. Imagine every little thing you encounter in life is a sign from some higher power. If you’re religious, this should hopefully come easy to you. Take anything, a gust of wind, a road sign, whatever you want,  just imagine its some divine power reaching out to you. Give it WHATEVER meaning YOU want, preferably positive.  
    
    With enough practice, you will find you can find meaning in literally everything.

Conclusion:

    I urge you all to practice and create exercises from the reading. This is almost like a DIY religion, but I would push more towards a philosophy. I borrowed ideas from various sciences and religious texts, none of these ideas are original to me. Please, please, please, use your journal and give this a shot.  
    
    You will find that you will be able to take hold of the reigns of life and give meaning to anything and everything while cultivating a healthy mindset. Be creative and own this process, it’s yours and no one can take it from you.  
    
    There are many more practices and exercises you can come up with, you will find that when you start on this path, you will gain momentum.

2. Do not slow down your car to wave. You are impeding traffic and you’re going to make someone hit you. And please keep your eyes on the road, if you’re still moving but slowly you’re going to be swerving all over the place or stopping suddenly and cause an accident.

3. DO NOT STOP. Don’t pull over to have a conversation. They are exercising. They don’t want to talk to you at this moment. The entire conversation 99/100, they are just looking for a pause to leave and  waiting for you to stop talking so they can move on. They are sweaty and uncomfortable and probably just want to go home. Plus, once again, could cause an accident. 

4. Do not call them. They are exercising, most likely listening to music or something and probably breathing heavily. They don’t want to talk to you right now. I don’t care how many times you call me, I am running. I will block your call 45 times in a row if I have to, and respond to it when I feel I’m ready. Leaving a voicemail after the first call attempt is fine by the way; I, personally, am more likely to listen to a voicemail while I’m running (on occasion) and I will respond to it when I can. 

5. For the love of god, and I can’t believe I have to say this, don’t swerve and pretend to hit them. It’s happened to me more than once. It’s not funny, it’s never been funny. That’s a real thing I worry about while running outdoors. It’s dangerous in all many ways. Don’t do it. 

Leave them alone. 

If you NEED to let them know you saw them, simply send them a text when you get home. That’s the best you can do, and they will respond when they see fit.","LPT: If you are driving down the street, and you see someone you know exercising, leave them alone."

If you let it ring, the system/caller is going to realize that the phone doesn't lead anywhere, and they will remove your number from their systems.

Scam call systems determine if the line is worth calling/targeting depending on if the line is functioning. If they see it is worth it, they can sell your working number to other companies and robocall systems to scam you and others.","LPT: If you get a call from a number that you don't know, do not touch the phone at all.

LifeProTips,"So, this seems like a stupid joke or common sense thing but hear me out. I see a lot of people who are still doing that, so this is why I posted this thread.

2 Years ago I was standing at a traffic light with my bike, waiting for it to turn green for me. This traffic light is at a main road where you can drive 50km/h(31mp/h) or up to 70km/h(43mp/h only if you want a speeding ticket). And as you know, those speeds are a massive force.

Without any Airbags or any other important safety measurement you would be really in danger. So, 16 year old me is standing at this traffic light while listening to some good music and is noticing that the traffic light is turning red for the cars. What I didnt notice was that a car at a high speed was coming from the left without any intention to break. So halfway through I noticed that a car just passed really close behind me. Now imagine I would have started to cross the road half a second later.

I would be a flat pancake probably, or with some luck pretty much paralyzed because these were no 50km/h. But this could have been easily avoided if I wouldnt have listened to some loud music at the traffic light because cars make really loud noises that you can literally hear from far away. You should never take yourself the ability to hear the environment, seriously.

So please, to all people who listen to music with noise cancelling headphones or just to loud music with normal headphones.. Dont do that, one day it might kill you.",LPT: Never listen to music with noise cancelling headphones/etc. while being outside
