For example I have a deck consisting of Korean vocabulary, but I have each card tagged under which lesson I got them from if I ever want to study just a single lesson’s vocab. 

Although what I find the most useful about Anki is the fact that it uses spaced repetition learning. After you review a card you basically judge whether it was easy, medium og hard to get, and based on that Anki judges how often it will show that card to you. If you choose that a card is hard to get, it will show that card to you more often than other cards until you deem that it is easy to get, whereas if you keep finding a card easy, more and more time will pass before it shows that card to you again.

LifeProTips,"When I learned this earlier on in life, it was a total game-changer.  I used to answer almost everything from anyone who asked, figuring it was the polite and the more social thing to do, but I would find out later how people often wouldn't use that information to really help out in any way.  Some people even use what they know about you *against* you, using it to start rumors, gain more control over you, or generally use it to undermine you in some way with others for their own self-oriented benefit.

One powerful thing to do if someone asks you something personal that you're unsure of is to immediately reverse it back on them by saying, ""Why do you ask?"" before answering anything.  If they don't have a good enough answer for why they want to know, then you can basically ignore their original question and move on.","LPT: You don't have to answer every question that comes your way from everyone.

LifeProTips,"From experience working in the travel industry, this is a common source of grievance with customers. When flying, renting a hotel room or a car, always check the rules and restrictions. Most 3rd-party booking sites (Priceline, Expedia, etc.) don't allow companies to keep these details on the front page of their site, but would rather keep them in secondary links toward the bottom of the rental summary. Making sure you have the proper payment types, security deposits, and qualifications before you book will only help you avoid undue stress. Definitely call the local business (because restrictions may change based on location) if you are unsure of any policies. Also, know that same-day booking/walk-ups are almost always more expensive than booking a week or two out.

Next, if you've booked more than a few days prior, it would be helpful to call said business a day or two prior to confirm the reservation. Airlines, car rental companies, and hotels all try to over-book whenever possible (usually at around 120% capacity). This ensures full utilization of their service due to cancelations and unqualified renters. Because of this, sometimes there is a shortage of rooms, seats, or vehicles. Calling a day or two out does two things:

1.) The company can input your information over the phone, expediting the process when you get there.
2.) You give the company surety that you will be there for what you reserved, so they would be more inclined to hold your rental, or upgrade you based on your forward thinking and courtesy.

The last thing any of these agents want is to be yelled at for things that are out of their control. Most of the issues (around 70% I'd say) are due to people not checking company policies before booking, and the booking sites don't make that very easy to do. Much of the remainder of issues is due to poor financial planning and unforseen costs by the customer.

Hopefully this helps with future travel planning.","LPT: When making travel reservations, call the local business to check for any rules and restrictions prior to booking. Then, call back a day or so prior to confirm the reservation and make sure of availability."

Anecdotally it seems that many people feel that away, even though we often enjoy being contacted.

LifeProTips,"Just so we are on the same *web*page, here is the description of [objectification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectification) from Wikipedia.

&gt;In  social philosophy, objectification is the act of treating a person, or  sometimes an animal, as an object or a thing. It is part of  dehumanization, the act of disavowing the humanity of others. Sexual  objectification, the act of treating a person as a mere object of sexual  desire, is a subset of objectification, as is self-objectification, the  objectification of one's self.

Here is how to objectify someone:

&gt;According to Martha Nussbaum, a person is objectified if one or more of the following properties are applied to them:  
\* Instrumentality – treating the person as a tool for another's purposes  
\* Denial of autonomy – treating the person as lacking in autonomy or self-determination  
\* Inertness – treating the person as lacking in agency or activity  
\* Fungibility – treating the person as interchangeable with (other) objects  
\* Violability – treating the person as lacking in boundary integrity and  violable, ""as something that it is permissible to break up, smash, break  into.""  
\* Ownership – treating the person as though they can be owned, bought, or sold  
\* Denial of subjectivity – treating the person as though there is no need for concern for their experiences or feelings  
Rae Langton proposed three more properties to be added to Nussbaum's list:  
\* Reduction to body – the treatment of a person as identified with their body, or body parts  
\* Reduction to appearance – the treatment of a person primarily in terms of how they look, or how they appear to the senses  
\* Silencing – the treatment of a person as if they are silent, lacking the capacity to speak

After reducing a person to an object, you no longer treat them as a person.  Their statements no longer have merit or worth.  You are no longer objective in the argument.  You can then *wrongly* justify doing whatever you want with them.

In a sense, you could treat them like a rock in the road.  You could kick them, trample them under your feet or throw them under the bus.  You would be inclined to argue with them like you would a rock... not at all.

I *object* to this form of treatment of another person (pun intended).","LPT: When in an argument, you cannot be objective if you objectify your opponent"

Rather than stress about it, learn to avoid revealing your identity to unknown phone numbers that attempt to contact you. If the agency can’t confirm your identity, they can’t report the account to the credit bureau, thus your credit score is never impacted in the first place.

If somebody asks to speak to you, *always* ask who’s calling and what it’s regarding. If they say they can’t say what it’s regarding until you confirm that you’re you, it’s almost definitely a creditor. Simply say, “He’s not in right now, I’ll tell him you called.” If the calls persist, then you say, “I’m sorry, he doesn’t have this number anymore and I don’t have a contact number for him.” That should stop the calls.

The same thing also applies to returning missed calls to unrecognized phone numbers. You may call back, and they may say, “Hi! Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?” This is a trick.

Got a giant 60 Inch TV in the house and a few months later the company went bankrupt and no updates from there on.

I checked the reviews and immediately got it. And I haven't regretted one bit. It has HDR inbuilt. Can play 4K on almost any device. Great sound. Steady Updates. Google Assistant and so much more.

LifeProTips,"Something I've realised is that goal-setting is an artform.

The personal development space likes to think of it as scientific, and evidence-based, but to me this misses the point. Crafting the right goal for the right person at the right time is so subjective, and really bloody complex.

Setting the wrong type of goal is like an artist choosing the wrong colours, or painting with a hammer instead of a paintbrush.

Just like any good artist needs to know the different tools and media that can make their vision come alive, I think we have to get the nuances in different types of goal. Maybe this is the difference between short-term and long-term changes. Goals are basically just tools for making our vision reality.

I’ve been doing some thinking about how to cluster different types of goal, and came up with 5 core types (theoretical at this point):

&amp;#x200B;

* **Life-Based Goals**: the most basic top-level goal i.e. dividing goals into life domain (money, family, health, career, social, etc etc.). The trick here is to reflect on core values and question everything first, rather than just plucking goals from thin air.
* **Time-Based Goals**: the next level down to me is long-term vs short-term goals. Depending on the choice, the magnitude of action we take will be completely different. This is crucial to get right and needs careful thought so we don't overwhelm ourselves.
* **SMART vs Stretch Goals**: SMART goals can be useful, but they're overhyped. They're great for short-term goals, but for longer-term goals it's not as important to be 'Realistic'. Stretch goals deal with that. They're big, exciting and compelling. It's not about achieving them, but about who they make us become by longing for them.
* **Objective vs Subjective Goals**: not all goals can be as objective as we'd like. SMART goals emphasise 'specificity' and 'measurability', but this is misguided. Try measuring 'spiritual connectedness' or 'groundedness'. Are these any lesser goals for not being very measurable?
* **Process vs Outcome Goals**: process goals (the habits and recurring strategies) generally trump outcome goals (the momentary achievements which come and go). As a society we get hung up on achievements, forgetting that the magic happens on the journey of growth. Process goals deal with this, by prioritising who we want to become along the way.
* &amp;#x200B;

LifeProTips,"This is a common problem nowadays: switching between browser tabs and apps on your phone, checking social media, messages and email, thinking of the millions of things that you need to do but postponed…

Doing everything but focusing on one task at a time. It's hard to get rid of the mental habit of switching, being distracted, allowing your mind to jump from one thing to another.

- Start with asking ‘’Why?:

Why should worry about this? It's best to think this through before diving into any plan, because when things get uncomfortable, you are going to need to understand why. Otherwise, you will collapse at the first urge to switch focus. Concentrating on one task at a time, at least during the day, will help you do the important things: write, program, study, take care of finances, create…etc.
If you feel stressed by everything you have to do, unhappy with your lack of concentration ... then this one skill will help you make a difference.


- Let’s move on to ‘’How’’?

- Method:

It’s quite simple, 
Select the Most Important Task (MIT), the first thing in the morning, before you call someone or go online, think about the things that you need to do.
What will matter most in your life, your job? If you have more than one thing to do, it doesn’t make a difference ... just randomly pick one to start with, 
You can get to them later, don't waste your time hesitating; the goal is to practice with one task at a time, this is the one task you choose for today - your Most Important task (MIT).

Finding the perfect place to be creative and productive can be tricky, especially at home.
In a home office, doing household chores, surrounded by distracting noises and constant interruptions, it’s impossible to work productively, on the other hand, isolating yourself in a quiet location can also be counterproductive.
You can create a friendly atmosphere with the Defonic sound generator, https://defonic.com/ for example; which helps block unwanted noises, and creating an atmosphere which encourages calmness and productivity.
The sounds made by the generator also create a calm environment for sleeping or relaxing after a long day.

Concentrate for 15 minutes. During those 15 minutes, you cannot switch to anything else. You only have two options. 
You can only: a) Work on your MIT, Or, b) Sit and do nothing.  These are your only options, watch your desires, but don't follow them.

That's all! One session per day for at least two weeks, if you managed it well, add your doing well, add a second session every day with a 10 minute break between sessions. In approximately six weeks to two months, you'll be able to focus for two 15-minute sessions, and then add the fourth one when it becomes manageable, pause for a while and then add another session in the afternoon.

- Some Important Tips

With this simple method in mind, there are a few key ideas:

1. Turn off the internet. This is the ideal way. If you need Internet for your MIT, close all the tabs except the one or two that you need to complete the task, and do not allow yourself to open anything else.

2. Its common these days for people to go to their local cafes to work, which is what Wi-Fi technology has allowed; For some people, the informal atmosphere of a cafe has a positive effect on productivity. You can use the Hipstersound web app https://hipstersound.com/ to experience the atmosphere of your favorite coffee shop from home while enjoying the increased productivity.

3. Increase the number of sessions as slowly as possible, don’t rush to do more. Focus on building a solid foundation.

LifeProTips,"Ordering from an app like DoorDash, Grubhub, Postmates, etc can be really expensive at times. On top of your food you’re paying Delivery and processing fees, as well as tip and it can all add up. However it doesn’t have to. 

ALWAYS google Promo codes for whichever app you’re using and you will find a ton ranging from different percents and even money amounts off an order. Especially if this is your first time ordering off the app cause they have really good discounts for first timers. These discounts switch monthly a lot of times too. Some are even restaurant specific so you can get good deals too. The best part is these codes are free.

While these apps may display some of the discounts they have to offer, you can find so much more on a website like Groupon. I was able to pay off all my delivery, processing, and tip with one, allowing me to just pay normal price for my food. 

These codes are one time use only normally, but they tend to switch out every month so you’ll always find good deals to save on. On big orders you can knock off huge price amount off. Again these codes are free so you’re only saving money here. Why not save a couple extra bucks when ordering food? Life is expensive enough

What it actually means to the child: Whatever we need to leave for is more important to me than you are.

Kids misbehaving? ""Uh oh, there police are going to come take you away,"" or, ""we're going to send you to live somewhere else."" 

What it actually means to the child: You're only welcome in my presence if you conform to my expectations.

It doesn't matter that these are empty threats, or even if the kid knows they're empty. The most important thing for healthy emotional and attachment development in children is that they have a secure, unconditional, and unthreatened relationship with their primary caregiver(s). Placing the responsibility on the child to maintain that relationship (like for example if they have to chase after you because you just said you're leaving without them), disrupts the parent-child dynamic and may actually cause more damage (and problematic behaviours) in the long-term.

The hard part is that these techniques are actually quite good at eliciting the desired (or eliminating the undesired) behaviour in the short term, which is why it's so tempting to fall back on them.",LPT: Don't Threaten Attachment as a Way to Modify Behaviour in Your Kids.

LifeProTips,"You got asked to hang out with your colleagues but you just want to stay at home doing nothing. So instead of making some excuse or succumbing to peer pressure you give them a 50-50 chance for coming. When they say to flip a coin then tell them that a coin is actually biased even if to a negligible extent, and that you really wanna come. 
By this time they are not into word play and wanna go with the flow of things, so you pull out some    pre-prepared props:
Just take 4 similar small pieces of paper and write ""YES"" or ""Y"" on 2 and ""NO"" or ""N"" on the other 2. Fold or crumble them and keep them on you at all times. The trick is to keep both similar answers in the same pocket. For ease keep YES in right pocket and NO in left. 
Take out a set from a pocket and tell them the obvious lie that one is Yes and the other is No. Now the pocket you select depends on the person standing before you, if they are likely to call your bluff by asking to open the other paper then you select from the opposite pocket. 
You Don't want to go so you select from the YES pocket and on presenting them, simply hold one up and either throw it or swallow it and say that whatever remains in the other paper is the opposite of what you selected, meaning a NO in this case.

There you have it the perfect way to dodge any social bullet.
If you still somehow manage to fuck this up and expose your similar chits then all you gotta do is act surprised and say that you keep 2 sets of chits in case one gets lost or you swallow/throw them, and then bring out the other 2 chits from the other pocket, and today you put them together by mistake instead of keeping them separated in your pockets.

I can't imagine any other royal screw-up with this simple method. With a coin you have 50% chance of losing but here you can say NO with manipulating probability all you want.

TL;DR Make 4 chits of paper saying 2 Yes and 2 No, fake chosing between them by keeping the 2 Yes and 2 No together and use them to get out of social situations.",LPT: Get out of any social obligation

LifeProTips,"LPT: Set up a plan (will, life insurance, written instructions for burial, any or all of the above) in case you get sick or are getting older. 

Sometimes we don’t realize that the confusion and concern around this adds another entire level of worry and stress to loved ones without the intent to do so. My father is older and has had some health problems severe enough to have these chats multiple times, and now that he is getting much older and I want to enjoy the time we have together, it is additionally very hard when there is no “plan” in place. Especially if the person in question is the “bread winner” to another spouse or dependent, please set up even an informal plan to take away that worry and stress. It can be hard trying to push someone to plan for this (especially if there is limited access to lawyers) but the mess about what would happen is daunting for those already struggling to process loved ones falling ill. Every little thing helps, even just written out wishes, and will take that stress and confusion off of loved ones if something were to happen. 

I even encourage young people to have something in place, just for ease of mind. Most corporate employers have company-paid (no cost to you) life insurance to sign up for that can serve as a safety net. Many also offer legal plans for the year for very cheap where you have access to lawyers if you plan to square things away and forget about it for some years. Some of those legal plan options have limited coverage for parents, and are worth asking about.

LifeProTips,"[Studies show](https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-reading-books#increases-empathy) that when you read, along with having fun, you build knowledge, increase vocabulary, improve writing, develop empathy, develop personal identity, improve life-achievement likelihood, and more. 

The problem is that reading is (typically) far less accessible, affordable, and user-friendly than Netflix.

With Netflix, there are always a hundred good shows that are recommended, trending, bookmarked, and shared, and you can instantly access any of them from anywhere.

You get what you want when you want it. And once you finish one show, you can instantly start the next. It’s frictionless. 

But with reading, you either have to make a long treks to a library or store, or you have to wait around for an Amazon delivery. 

If you don't like the books you chose, you have to rinse and repeat the whole lengthy process. Plus, buying new books and magazines is far more expensive than just using Netflix.

But it doesn't have to be like this. Here are some ideas I came up with to make reading like Netflix.

&amp;#x200B;

#### GIVE YOURSELF QUICK ACCESS TO LOTS OF CHEAP OR FREE READING MATERIALS

&amp;#x200B;

#### --- Fill an E-Reader or Phone to The Brim With Good Content. 

&amp;#x200B;

To give yourself lots of books to read, you can download free E-books from [manybooks.com](http://manybooks.com/). There are also several other places to get free books; just have a look around on Google.  

With a ton of books ready to go, if you ever get sick of a book, or finish one, you can quickly start a new one. No more waiting for deliveries, or going for long treks.  

You can also subscribe to several magazines and newspapers on your E-reader or phone, so you always have something quick and easy to read. 

And, although it can be hard to flip through the pages of an E-book, it is easy to flip through the pages of an e-magazine or e-newspaper. They really do a slick job with the menus. 

&amp;#x200B;

\---- SET UP AN RSS FEED

&amp;#x200B;

RSS feeds are like a Facebook Newsfeed of all of your favorite websites.

The way it works is that you add different websites into your RSS reader, and then you can just go to your RSS reader to read all the content from your favorite websites.

By putting all your favorite content in one place, you save time from having to visit each website independently.

I really like Feedly as my RSS reader. And to bring it back to the point of this post, if you start going to Feedly as a form of entertainment, you will definitely read more. 

Go [here to watch a video](https://conorwriter.com/rss-feed/) if you want to understand better how RSS works. 

Also, if you have a Kindle - you can send your RSS to your kindle with [www.kindle4rss.com](https://www.kindle4rss.com)

&amp;#x200B;

\--- BUY BOOKS AND MAGAZINES FROM YOUR LOCAL THRIFT STORE

&amp;#x200B;

Buy books and magazines from your local thrift store and then leave them in easy to reach places around your house ( by your bed, next to the toilet, etc  ) 

&amp;#x200B;

\--- LISTEN TO BOOKS AND ARTICLES

&amp;#x200B;

Listening to books and articles may not count in your books, but it does in mine.

Studies show that audiobooks can improve your reading accuracy, speed, fluency, pronunciation, comprehension, and more.

You can find a lot of great audiobooks for free on YouTube. Podcasts may also provide many of the same benefits; however, I doubt conversational podcasts will be as beneficial linguistically as a well-produced audiobook, but who doesn't love a good conversational podcast. In the end, having a good time is probably more important!

Another alternative that you may enjoy is the AUDM App.

With the Audm app, you get to listen to stories from the most prestigious publishers including *The New Yorker, The Atlantic, WIRED, Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone, The New York Times*, and many more. 

There are a good amount of new stories added every day, and although they can be a bit depressing, its deffinitely an App worth having. 

&amp;#x200B;

\---- MAKE READING SOCIAL

&amp;#x200B;

You can join a book club in your area, or you can join an online book club. r/bookclub

Also, it can be helpful to ask close friends about a book they like, because if you read it, you are showing them you care about their recommendations, and you will have someone to talk to about the book. 

&amp;#x200B;

\---- CONCLUSION

Good luck reading more!

I am set in my ways moreso now than ever before simply because of the coronavirus pandemic and all the restrictions it has caused, and the removal from my job \[temporarily\] for months at a time. It has enabled me to perpetuate my bad habits and has made my return to my regular full-time schedule very difficult. I have no doubt that many people will identify with me here.

There are tricks to dealing with these sudden life changes. We can get through this. This is my personal strategy that has been working for me while I prepare to return to the 9-5 with peers and students at my behest in the best interest of them all.

&amp;#x200B;

* Be Hyper-Vigilant. If you are in a working capacity like myself where you had no choice as to how close of contact you will have, protect yourself. That means masks, gloves, face-shields. You have a right to protection and are justified in requesting it. Just be understanding with the people that help you in those regards.
* Provide positive affirmation to yourself. Personally I write nice notes to myself on sticky notes and stick them in places that I can't avoid them. I.E., the door handle of my apartment. I cant leave without seeing what I wrote, so I almost have to. Be it a to-do list for the day or an uplifting quote from the day before; anything in-between - it is important that in these times of literally avoiding others we try to take more careful attention to ourselves.
* Treat others with respect and empathy. Many of us are afraid. *Many* more of us would rather stay at home and avoid everyone during these trying times. Be mindful of the wariness of others and try to understand that emotions over this period of time ranges from indifference, to denial, to outright fear and apprehension. It is all rightfully placed. Do what is best for everyone in the worst of circumstances.

LifeProTips,"I thought I'd share this ""hack"" I use for nicer pieces of clothing and better fits because I have a difficult body type.
If you have decent credit, opening a Nordstrom credit card (which is able to be used anywhere) will give you points towards a Nordstrom note (essentially a gift card as you don't have to use any other funds with it) that can be used at both Nordstrom and the rack. I use the credit card to pay all my bills with, then pay the card off in cash each month. Then I use the notes that come free for having paid for my necessities to buy nicer pieces of denim or shoes.
The other perk (hence the title) is that they offer two hundred dollars of free tailoring a year, and this doesn't exclude clothes purchased elsewhere. I now will go to Goodwill (when we could still shop) and find things almost perfect for me, then take them to Nordstrom to be tailored, and it instantly looked like I had a million dollar outfit.

LifeProTips,"I always had that last little bit of stubble that just wouldn't come off, so I thought about  it a bit.

I finally likened the razor to a knife blade cutting through steak, and that's when it hit me.  You don't push a knife straight through the steak straight-on.  You actually push it through **while drawing it across the surface at the same time** (resulting in a non-90 degree angle of attack, using 45 degrees for the sake of argument here).

So I thought I'd try it...pulling the razor while moving it at an angle...and hot-damn-tamale, it worked!  It was the closest shave I'd ever had in my life.

It does take some practice because it's very counter-intuitive...because we're told that anything but perpendicular to the blade will slice our throats.  And, to be honest, I did cut myself a few times, but there was usually some other reason that it happened there (pimple, bump, etc.).

LifeProTips,"**1) EAT SLOW LIKE A SLOTH**

Once we start eating, it can take up to 20 minutes for the brain to register that the body is full, and as a result, we should eat slower so that we don’t accidentally overeat before our brain has a chance to slow us down.

This brain-belly lag is an obvious reason to eat slower, but it’s not the only reason.

In 2015, a study showed that the group of adults who ate soup slowly reported feeling fuller than another comparable group of adults who ate quickly. Perhaps the length of time we eat also helps the brain measure how full it feels? Maybe it isn’t just cues from our gut that tells us we’re full, maybe our eyes and our sense of time spent eating affect our perceived fullness as well?

Whatever the reasons, scientists are still not fully sure why, eating slowly helps us eat less, feel more full from a comparable amount of food, and if we do it often enough, it gives us a higher probability of having a lower body mass index.

To try to eat slower, I am going to:

* Chew more ( maybe even count my chews )
* Frequently put my utensils down while I eat
* Breathe a few times between bites
* Eat more fiber ( it takes a long time to chew )
* Eat with chopsticks
* Take smaller bites
* Avoid distractions ( less TV and Social Media while eating; more on this below)
* Eat mindfully ( think about my bites and savor the flavor; more on this below )

To learn more about the benefits of eating slowly, [check out this article](https://www.precisionnutrition.com/all-about-slow-eating) by [Brian St. Pierre, MS, RD, CSCS](https://www.precisionnutrition.com/author/brian-st-pierre).

*“ The benefits of slow eating include better digestion, better hydration, easier weight loss or maintenance, and greater satisfaction with our meals. Meanwhile, eating quickly leads to poor digestion, increased weight gain, and lower satisfaction. The message is clear: Slow down your eating and enjoy improved health and well-being.”*

*-*

***2)*** **AVOID DISTRACTIONS WHILE YOU EAT ( LESS TV &amp; MOVIES )**

One of the benefits discussed above about eating slowly was that it helps us feel more full than if we ate the same amount of food quickly. Also, as discussed above, this phenomenon may, in part, be caused by a mechanism in our brain that signals how much it's eaten based on how much time it has spent focusing on the act of eating. Feeling full is not just a signal that our brain receives from our stomach, there's more to it than that.

As a result of our brain's perception of time spent eating playing a role in how much we eat and how full we feel, you can start to see why distracted eating gets such a bad rap.

But don't just take my word for it, this [2013 review of 24 studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3607652/) concluded much the same; distracted eating seems to cause a moderate increase in the amount eaten in a meal, and an even greater increase in the amount that people ate later that day. In other words, distracted eating makes you eat more in a sitting, and it makes you think that you ate less.

To pull this back to this article about my portion control problem at big dinners, I've come up with the following.

* Eat less in front of the TV when I am with my partner; I can watch TV afterward.
* Talk more about the food that I am eating. ( Dinner parties or at Home )
* Remember my tips for eating slower
* Remember to be mindful when I eat ( think about every bite and savor the flavor; more on this below )

\-

**3)** **EAT MINDFULLY**

Mindfulness is defined as *"" a mental state achieved by focusing one's awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one's feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations, used as a therapeutic technique*.""

To mindfully eat, you must do the above while you eat.

A [2014 review of 21 studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4046117/) discovered that 18 of the studies found that mindful eating helped to decrease binge and emotional eating.

Also, as discussed above, paying attention to your food helps you eat less and feel more satisfied with what you eat. Seeing as mindfulness is a way of paying attention, it should help you eat less and feel more full.

\-

**4) LIMIT AlCOHOL**

When trying to eat less at big dinners, limiting alcohol is a good way to avoid a surprising amount of empty calories. ( calories that cause weight gain without any nutrition )

What's more, scientists have found that alcohol causes hunger and eating. A [2017 study](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14014) even found that alcohol stimulates parts of the brain that are associated with starvation.

**Tips to Avoid Alcohol:**

* **Drink Coffee**: Coffee taste horrible with most types of alcohol, and barring any cream or sugar, it has no calories.
* **Drink Kombucha, flavored carbonated water, or regular carbonated water:** Most of us drink alcohol because it taste fun! So, try to find something fun to drink instead. If it is calorie free, that is ideal, but as long as it doesn't have ethanol, you should be free from the infamous alcohol induced face stuffing, and that's the important part.
* **Drink Tea:** If there is no decaff coffee, or if you prefer tea, drink some tea with dinner.

\-

**5) MAKE A PLATE AND EAT INTENTIONALLY**

When I eat appetizers at a dinner party, I usually pick at them intermittently as I wait for dinner. For example, with a pre-dinner charcuterie board, I often prepare myself a cracker with cheese and hot pepper jelly once or twice a minute. In a thirty-minute wait, that can add up to hundreds of calories.

Similarly, when I eat take-out at home, I sometimes have several take-out boxes in front of me and it can be really hard to know how much I eat.

In both cases, I can be more intentional about how much I eat by making myself a plate before I start eating. Some may even recommend that I use a small plate so that it looks like a lot more food than it is. This small-plate technique is good for me with appetizers, but my main dish needs to be at least one big plate or I will feel quite unsatisfied.

Another best practice is to leave the food out of hands' reach after I make my plate. If I'm too close to the appetizers or take-out boxes, food will slide onto my plate. No getting around it, I need space from my food; which reminds me of another good piece of advice; don't eat standing in the fridge.

\-

**6) DESERT PALLETE CLEANSERS**

The second something sweet touches my lips, I lose control. I'm like a shark that smells blood. The only thing that helps is cleansing my palate after a serving of dessert.

Here's how you do it:

* Go to washroom and rinse your mouth ( extreme )
* Drink some carbonated or normal water
* Listerine patch or gum
* Swish water, tea, alcohol or w/e else you have around in your mouth

Conclusion

I hope this guide helps you overeat less. Thus far, it's worked pretty well for me.

LifeProTips,"I realize there are going to be some polar opposite opinions here - but if you are at all planning a wedding that goes beyond you and your immediate family members and such, getting a wedding planner will save you endless headaches and actually allow you to enjoy the day of your wedding. 

I'm in that phase of life where all my college/high school friends have been getting married, and the difference is literally night and day. I've been to five weddings now where the bride and groom planned the day of, and every single time without fail they've spent the day double and triple checking lists, showing up late to various activities, missing out on things/photos they wanted to take, stressing about whether all the food was going to come out right, and in one case without asking anyone to run out to buy more beer. (If they'd mentioned it to anyone there they would've done it for them.) 

I've been to two weddings where a wedding planner was involved, and all I can say is that the difference is astounding. Even for a small (50 person) wedding it was light-years different. The bride and groom were stress free, everything went like a smoothly oiled machine, and the couple was clearly enjoying dancing on the dance floor instead of figuring out where they'd put the last case of vodka.

I'm not going to say that a wedding planner solves all problems with your wedding, and they are certainly a bit of a luxury expense, and I've definitely heard more than a couple horror stories.

LifeProTips,"When I got my first graduate job I had literally £30 until payday, and only a handful of suitable smart casual clothes. It took a little bit of trial and error, but over the next few years I learned a lot about how to spend the minimum and keep up a professional appearance. 

Choose natural fibres like cotton, linen or wool over polyester if you can, as they wash better and will keep you cool in an overheated office

Buy classic, plain colours like olive, navy, black, grey, beige and white, as you can mix and match. It might not be your style, but if you keep it simple you can’t fuck it up, and people are less likely to spot you rewearing the same items again and again. 

Inexpensive clothes can be sloppily made, but you can hide that by cutting off any loose threads at the ends of seams, checking for loose buttons and resewing, ironing flat puckered seams. 

Even the cheapest men’s clothes are often better made than the female equivalent. A plain white T shirt in size S or M from the men’s basics section with the bottom 3 inches cut off is way better. 

A dab of clear nail polish to the thread in the middle of shirt buttons will stop them unravelling and falling off. If your shirt doesn’t come with a spare sewn to the label, you can take a button from the bottom and move it up. 

Don’t wash your clothes too often as it wears out your clothes - provided you have good hygiene yourself you can usually get at least a couple of wears out of tops and shirts, more for trousers and skirts.

A hand-held clothes steamer is quicker and takes up less space than an ironing board. You can get one for under £20 and you’ll look 100% more groomed if your clothes are crease free and hanging right. 

You can’t save money everywhere - cheap accessories look cheap, and it’s better to buy a leather belt and bag second hand than plastic lookalikes. Unfortunately I never found a way round the expense of shoes - for the sake of your feet it’s best to buy those new, as expensive as you can afford.

LifeProTips,"All you have to do is:

1.) Fill a gallon-size Ziploc bag with pork rinds and use a rolling pin to crush them down into a fine powder.

2.) Toss whichever seasonings you want into the bag, and shake it up well.

3.) Coat the chicken with an egg wash and cover them with the crumbs.

4.) Fry and enjoy!

Your chicken will turn out a bit crisper and should still have that beautiful, golden-brown look. They also won't sustain the flavor of the pork rinds. If you didn't tell anyone that that's what you used, they'd probably never know. I personally prefer the flavor and consistency over traditional breading.

\- How do i manage my expectations? I feel like sometimes, im too critical, but at the same time, i don't want to leave a toxic/stressful home, to then only be stressed and unhappy in my new home while losing rent etc... you know?

\- How do i get rid of the fear? Keep thinking about the worst case scenario's, like what if i suddenly lose my job and can't pay my rent anymore? I have nothing to fall back on once i leave. What if my neighbors are extremely loud and obnoxious? etc..

Some tips would be really appreciated, thank you",LPT Request - As someone with no support/guidance from family etc.. How do i best go about hunting for an appartment?

LifeProTips,"I know we are in the middle of a pandemic and travelling isn't on most people's minds right now especially with all the travel bans and restrictions however I have a tip to how you can save money for your next trip.

The Economist has this index called the Big Mac Index which ranks how much the same amount of goods and services costs in different countries. You can use the Big Mac Index to see which countries are cheap for you to travel to by comparing your home country's currency to your destination's currency. The more devalued the destination is to your currency the more cheaper it is to travel there, the more overvalued the more expensive it is and so on. If you want to take this even further you can look at historical exchange rates within the past few years on google and find out if your currency is at an all time high or low compared to past rates. (For example the US Dollar is at a historic high against the Brazilian Real so if you're American it hasn't been as cheap to visit Brazil in the past few years as it is to now.)

LifeProTips,"I (an American) sort of just came up with this when I was traveling in Europe. When talking about ""human temperatures,"" I think in Fahrenheit, so it was useful to be able to convert temperatures quickly into the units I'm more familiar with. 

I noticed a lot of people didn't bother actually doing the math to convert, probably because the formula they were taught involved fractions (specifically 5/9) which can be ugly to do in your head straightaway. So here's an easy way to approach it:

Take the temperature, in Celsius, and multiply it by 2.

Take 10% of that and subtract it from the number you got in the previous step.

Add 32 to that number.

This actually gets you an exact answer, but if you approximate your 10% you'll still get really close.

Example @ 15 °C:

15 × 2 = 30

10% of 30 = 3

30 - 3 = 27

27 + 32 = 59

You can do the steps in reverse to go from Fahrenheit to Celsius, but using 10% no longer yields an exact answer. Really, you'd need 11.111..% which is no longer ""easy to do in your head"" - you *can* get REALLY close, but you'll have to do your 10% operation recursively.",LPT: Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit in your head

I traveled home alot for holidays, and didn't like spending more than $1000 for a round trip between three states. I started on the Google flight widget and planned my trip in my usual browser, then opened the incognito window with the same search results, same flights, and found it was at least 50% cheaper. I did it for a friend recently who wanted to fly back east for her sister's funeral, and she was complaining that she was looking at 1800 for a round trip over the course of three weeks. She blamed it on Covid, but I found her a cheaper trip using this method going for about 800$ round trip.

LifeProTips,"Sugar is really bad for you. But in small doses it can do wonders. Simply choose a simple exercise (pushups, squats, or jumping jacks- whatever gets your heart pumping a bit) and a number of reps that makes you feel some burn but doesn't exhaust you. Do five sets of that number, each time taking a break to eat a very small sweet snack. By the end you should be pumped full of endorphins and glucose, a powerful mix that can kill many a bad mood. 

This is not, however, a cure for any sadness. Only do so when in serious distress, or when you feel out of control of, or maybe trapped by, your emotions. You can do simple things to give yourself joy in those moments. 

Long term, doing cardiovascular exercise on a regular basis is a much better for your mental and physical health, but when in urgent need of feel-good-ness, sugar and exercise are priceless.

LifeProTips,"So just a random thing I learned today/just now.

I went to Staples to get some motorcycle service manuals printed and bound for me.

I wanted to use nice glossy textbook style paper so that it lasts longer and it's more resistant to dirt and oil.

It was going to cost me nearly $120 USD PER book to print (about 400 pages each.. But double sided, so about 200 actual pages). AND, it was going to take a few days to print because the paper I wanted was only available at their off-site printing facility.

I told the lady at the counter that was too expensive, and asked if she could go over other options. She told me that I could save a lot more money if I bought whole reams of paper myself and brought it to them. So she walked me over to the paper aisle and showed me nearly identical paper to the one I wanted. It was $19 per ream.

So for the 2 reams of paper, plus a couple 3-ring binders... It came out to $150 for BOTH books, AND it will be ready by end of today.","LPT: Printing Services - Learned today if you provide your own paper, sometimes it's significantly cheaper"

LifeProTips,"This actually happened with me when I was a child, around 10. I fell asleep on the bus home and ended up getting off at the next village (we don't have school buses, only regular buses).

I went along because I felt embarrassed that I didn't know who they were, and whenever my parents met with other adults I had to act like I knew them because otherwise I was made fun of, which was something I took very hard as a kid. I was lucky because the men in the car weren't lying, they actually took me home, but this stuck with me ever since. It could have gone very bad too.

LifeProTips,"I have worked in the food service business for years and trust me, you want to do this. Obviously every restaurant is going to clean all of their Utensils and cups and plates in the dishwasher and restaurants with fancy cloth napkins will put them in the washing machine. But how many people do you think have used them, put their mouths on them. How many do you think have been dropped and just picked back up and put into the rotation. 

The dish washers are almost never cleaned as regularly as they should be. They are filled with bits of food and bacteria and the soap most use are cheap low quality soaps and most are not antibacterial. MOST ARE NOT ANTICBACTERIAL. there are lots of germs just being swirled around in there. 

Bring your own drinks like soda because the machines used to pour drinks are also rarely cleaned. The nozzles on the hose distributes many different drinks and they are also germ ridden. 

Bring your own paper napkins.  If a restaurant has paper nakins you’re probably fine and don’t have to do this. But the cloth ones is a different ball game.
