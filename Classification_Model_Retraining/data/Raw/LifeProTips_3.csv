LifeProTips,"Sleep is extremely important, we can all agree on that. Flipping your mattress helps to prevent too much wear on a single side and keeps your mattress usable. You should flip it about once a year. You probably never did it so do it today! I just did it and it feels like a freshly made bed x10.",LPT flip your mattress today!
LifeProTips,"As an EMT with a private company, our contracts are mainly with nursing homes in the area. We are in and out of those places multiple times for many different reasons on a day by day basis. We quickly get familiar with the patients, the RNs CNAs, LPNs, sometimes the physical/occupational therapists and janitorial crews. We see the day to day living conditions and treatment of patients. We see things, hear things, (smell things!) and sometimes have to deal with things inside of those facilities.

That being said, I'm not trying to scare anyone, most facilities are great! But there are other facilities we dread getting calls to, and some we feel bad we have to drop patients off at. EMTs do the job for various reasons but we as individuals are not loyal to any one facility (even if our company has the contract it is the company that pays us, not the facility directly) and from my experience, we are willing to honestly tell someone what we think of certain facilities.

Things to consider when you want to ask. First, find out which local company has the contract with the facility(ies) you are thinking of placing your loved one in. It is not hidden/private knowledge so the facility should be able to tell you without an issue.

Second (and important!): Do not approach any EMTs while they are with a patient, OR if they are inside the specific facility. We may be truthful, but it is possible to get in trouble if someone from the facility hears us talk negatively about it. Wait until you see the EMTs without a patient (empty stretcher) and at least outside of the facility. Best thing would be to be as far from an entrance as possible. If you happen to see an EMT at a store, chances are they have a few minutes to answer some questions.

Third: do not ask them while they are transporting your loved one. I typically got asked this question by a family member in the back of the ambulance with their awake and aware family member while we were heading to said facility as a new admission. I felt bad, but tried to be as truthful as possible without negatively talking about the facility. For me, it made me feel awkward as you are already heading to the facility, its too late to change places, and I wouldnt want you or your loved one to go in thinking its the worst place.

All that being said, we do not see EVERYTHING going on inside the facility and we have experienced varying stories from patient to patient. But there are some facilities that we as EMTs can all agree are terrible and those places are the ones you want to stay away from. I also understand sometimes placing your loved one in a facility could rely on insurances, so your options may be limited. But I still feel you should be at least warned/notified/educated.","LPT: If you have a loved one that needs to go to a rehab/nursing home, ask an EMT from a private company for recommendations."

LifeProTips,"Only sign up for services that you have researched and decided upon yourself, and be wary of ""free"" trials. I was always good about this sort of thing, but I just learned a lesson the hard way.

I signed up for a Spectrum internet package, 200gbps internet at $50/mo for 24 months. A few months in, I got a call from Spectrum offering a 2 week free trial for their TV streaming service. The guy said I could cancel at any time, no strings attached etc., so I agreed to try it. I just called to cancel after 2 weeks, and they informed me that you cannot take promotions off your plan, you can only add them. Therefore if I wanted to cancel the TV streaming I would lose my internet promotion plan and I'd have to pay the full internet package rate. I didn't even ask what the full price 200gbps internet cost per month, but they have a 75gbps package for $70/mo. I asked if I could just sign up for the same internet promotional package again, and they said that when you cancel a service, you cannot sign up for a promotion for another 3 months. So, I could either pay $75/mo for 200gbps internet + a useless TV streaming service, or pay $70/mo for 75gbps internet for 3 months until I can sign on for a new package—I get to have the fun experience of being on the phone for 2 hours to change packages again (if they'll even let me).

Lesson learned. I'm sure that anyone who signs up for a discounted internet package gets targeted with ""free trials"" all the time so they can try to pull this scam. I was happy with Spectrum before all this which just goes to show that even if your service provider seems good, they are always thinking up their next scam.","LPT: Do not accept trials or ""cancel at any time"" offers from your service providers if they are the ones who contacted you."

Houses in my Midwestern US city regularly sell at or above their asking price after only a day or two on the market. This means that there are often multiple offers from which a seller can choose to accept. If you suspect that you don't have the best offer, you can write a personal letter to the seller to explain who you are and what living in the house would mean to you. Don't grovel or make things up, just explain the connection you feel to the property. Including a nice picture or two also goes a long way toward turning you into a human instead of numbers on a sheet of paper.

In our example, we didn't get to meet the owner before submitting an offer; however, we knew a few things about him just from touring the home. We saw doggy food bowls in the kitchen, so we included our dog Watson in our letter (he even signed it!) It was apparent from the garage that the owner liked cars; I included a line about how I was hoping to use the big garage as my shop. Lastly, our agent said the seller would finish renovating the basement before the closing.

LifeProTips,"This is an example of survival in a confined space. A typical coffin measures 84"" x 28"" x 23"" having a volume of 61,023 cubic inches (CI). The breathing rate when entrapped is 763 CI/minute, oxygen consumption is 31 CI/min and carbon dioxide expelled is 24 CI/min.
Volume of oxygen is 21% of the total volume or 11,360 CI and the initial CO2 is zero. Breathing the trapped air in the volume you would consume oxygen and expel CO2. Carbon dioxide concentration is the governing survival parameter in this case.
As the carbon dioxide content of the inspired air rises, the breathing rate becomes faster. Normal air is 0.03% carbon dioxide. The TLV-TWA (time-weighted threshold limit value) for carbon dioxide is 0.5 per cent , headache and an increased rate of breathing occur at 1%, at 3% a doubling of normal breathing rate occurs. Panting and intoxication occur above 5% with unconsciousness at about 10%.
Given the breathing rate above, the CO2 concentration would increase over time. Using a breathing rate of 763 CI/min the CO2 concentration would reach 0.5% after 11 minutes, 1% after 22 minutes, 1.26% after 28 minutes and 3% at 65 minutes. At 3% a doubling of the breathing rate occurs. The CO2 concentration would reach 5% at about 87 minutes.
Since you are most likely at maximum exertion trying to dig yourself out, your breathing rate would rise to 3966 CI/min with CO2 expelled at 195 CI/min. Under these conditions you reach 3% CO2 concentration at 8 minutes, 5% at 11-14 minutes, and 10% at 18-28 minutes. At 10% unconsciousness sets in.Even if it was feasible to dig yourself out; you would have to do it within 18-28 minutes of being sealed up.

LifeProTips,"Was just doing some calculations. 100 grocery bags bags at $0.05 a piece ($5) end up being cheaper than glad garbage bags which are about $10.

Some of the grocery bags are weaker and have holes in them but others do not. Grocery chains have different quality bags. 

So long as you reuse your grocery bags as garbage bags I don't see how it would be worse for the environment. 

You essentially save half of your money if you reuse. You also save on the cost of those sturdy cloth bags. The environment also takes a hit when those bags are made. The cardboard box that the glad bags come in are also taken from the environment whereas the grocery store gets thousands of bags in a single box, reducing the amount of cardboard used.

Rough calculations: 
4 small garbage bins in your house which you change once a week. This is 208 per year and reusing grocery bags would save you ~$10 per year.

The issue would be if you end up with too many grocery bags. So to resolve this you would use a combination of cloth bags and just enough grocery bags. Then donate that extra $10 a year to an environmental cause or keep it.

LifeProTips,"With sexual assault and other traumatic events we often talk about steps to help the person directly affected heal and that is, of course, incredibly important and we should continue those necessary talks. But often times there are **secondary victims** and I haven’t seen much discussion about how to help them.

From personal experience, I can say that the stress and panic of supporting a partner after a sexual assault can be overwhelming and research would support this. ([source 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22594219/)) ([source 2](http://www.uky.edu/~rremer/secondarysur/TREATCHP.doc)) On top of that, being a support system is a very vital role. Studies have shown that a partner’s and/or family’s response and behavior are incredibly indicative of how well a survivor will heal. ([source 3](https://aifs.gov.au/publications/ripple-effects-sexual-assault/secondary-victims-sexual-assault)) That’s a lot of pressure. Not only are you hearing, maybe frequently, the horrific details of what your loved one went through but you know that you need to stay strong for them even though you feel broken down. This is why the partner is sometimes called the “secondary victim” of rape and why they may develop PTSD. ([source 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22594219/))

There’s also a condition called Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS)* that is similar to post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It’s defined as “the emotional duress that results when an individual hears about the firsthand trauma experiences of another.” ([source 4](https://www.nctsn.org/trauma-informed-care/secondary-traumatic-stress)) Generally this is talked about regarding people in a professional field who’re exposed to traumatic stories: mental health professionals, educators, social workers, etc. however it can also apply to family members or other loved ones. ([source 5](https://istss.org/public-resources/trauma-blog/2002-summer/trauma-to-one-family-member-affects-entire-family)) 

Anecdotally, from my experience and talking with others, it’s common to try to focus on your partner getting better and neglecting yourself. You don’t want to weight them down with your own feelings. You may even feel guilty for feeling panic or trauma because you were not the one attacked. Keeping this all inside isn’t healthy though. It also makes it harder for you to be there for your partner and it can cause you real emotional distress. ([source 5](https://istss.org/public-resources/trauma-blog/2002-summer/trauma-to-one-family-member-affects-entire-family)) ([source 2](http://www.uky.edu/~rremer/secondarysur/TREATCHP.doc)) 

A good therapist can really help you heal. You may be experiencing a legitimate mental health condition like PTSD and should feel no shame or guilt in seeking out help yourself. ([source 6/resource link](https://www.cafyonline.org/get-help/survivor-resources/secondary-victims/))

Also, if you’re a professional who hears or witnesses the trauma of others, please consider help yourself.

LifeProTips,"Introduction

For almost the last decade, I have been addicted to the screen.  YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Reddit ~~(sorry Reddit)~~ either ruined my self-confidence, fueled my procrastination, or took my entire attention away from things that mattered, like my family, friends, and school work.  I wanted to dedicate time to eating healthy, getting ripped at the gym, learning tons of new things, and reading lots of books.  But I always lost sight of my goals because the immediate comfort of my phone was more enticing and pleasurable than putting effort towards my goals.

Alas, it’s hard to quit your screen addiction.  iOS has made it hard for iPhone addicts to cure their addiction.  While Screen Time allows you to limit your phone usage, app limits can be overridden by pressing the ‘ignore limit’ button.  Often the iOS bugs allow you to overstay your time limit on websites you don’t want to be overstaying.  You can also set passcodes to make it harder to remove previous app limits, but those passcodes can always be retrieved if you know your Apple ID.

Below I outline how I completely cured by iPhone addiction.  Hopefully, this helps.

Step-by-step

1. Create a fake email or use an old one.
   1. When you create a fake email or use an old one, be sure to set your new password to something extremely complicated.  I used [https://passwordsgenerator.net](https://passwordsgenerator.net/) to generate a 30-character password that you’ll certainly never remember.
   2. Write down the password on a piece of paper or index card.  
2. Create a new Apple ID
   1. Using the email in Step 1, create an Apple ID.
   2. When you answer the ‘Special Questions’, select random questions and enter gibberish characters (like ‘asklfas;lk;adf’) as the answers.
   3. Set your password to the password in Step 1, or create another extremely complicated, 30-character password (which you should also write down on a piece of paper or index card).
3. Setting a Screen Time passcode
   1. Set a screen time passcode you will remember, and when prompted, enter your real Apple ID (not the fake one you created in Step 2).
4. Settings &gt; Screen Time &gt; Downtime
   1. Enter your Screen Time passcode.
   2. Set the time periods during the day when you are most on your phone.  For me, this is between the hours of 11PM and 7AM.  
   3. Make sure to turn on the ‘Block at Downtime’ button, which means that all apps and functions on your phone will be stopped between your downtime hours.  If you are worried about some apps not being available in the case of an emergency during downtime, go to Screen Time &gt; ‘Always Allowed’ and set the apps you want available at all times. 
5. Settings &gt; Screen Time &gt; App Limits
   1. Enter your Screen Time passcode.
   2. Set time limits for certain apps and websites on your phone during the hours when Downtime is off.  I set time limits for nearly all apps except Google Maps and Clock.  Websites like youtube.com, reddit.com, amongst others were all set to a 30min time limit every day.
   3. Make sure to turn on the ‘Block at End of Limit’ button, which means that you won’t have the option to ‘Ignore Limit’ once you have run out of app time.
6. REVIEW
   1. Make sure that everything is set how you want it.
7. Setting a new Screen Time passcode
   1. Ask someone (friend, parent) to set a 4-digit Screen Time passcode for you, but not tell you what it is.
   2. When the phone prompts you to enter an Apple ID and password to recover the Screen Time passcode, enter the Apple ID and password you created in Step 2.
   3. Give the paper with your Apple ID and/or email password information to someone you trust, like a parent or grandparent, who will hide and keep it for you on your behalf in the event that you have an emergency and have to access an app or website.  I have never had this kind of ‘emergency’, since sites like youtube.com or reddit.com are rarely useful in the case of real emergencies.  

In the end, you should have essentially completely eliminated all possibilities of overriding any limits or recovering any passcodes.  This kind of change is essentially permanent until you have the Apple ID/email password information.  

Thank god I quit my phone addiction.  I’ve never felt so free in my life.  I can’t wait to lose more weight, spend more time with friends and family, get ripped, and have a much better life!

LifeProTips,"We often spend so much of our lives worrying about the future and our choices that it can hold us back from achieving our true potential.

Jim Carrey gave a commencement speech in 2014 at the Maharishi University of Management to 285 students where he shared lessons that he learnt over the course of his life and career. He gives specific anecdotes that can help you stop worrying about the future and taking a chance on yourself. He said ""So many of us choose our path out of fear disguised as practicality""

We spend so much of our time thinking about where our lives will take us and whether the risks that we take will pay off. The trick is to let go of controlling the outcome and focus on the process of what you're doing.

There may be an element of fearing failure that can be attached to this as well. However, you can beat this if you're continuing to pursue things that you love. TBH you can fail at anything so you might as well fail at what you love, rather than something you don't care about.",If you're worried about the future
LifeProTips,"I learned this years and years ago when I used to teach SAT prep classes and it's stuck with me since then. I remember the first time one of bosses shared this with me I was skeptical, but now it's what I always do, and it makes a huge difference!
When you ask ""do you have any questions?"" it pre-supposes that the person doesn't have any questions. It's like saying ""you don't have any questions right? because if you did, you're stupid"". It's even worse if you are in a position of authority over the person your explaining something to (i.e. you're a teacher, a supervisor, etc...)
When you ask ""what questions do you have?"" it's like telling the person ""I expect you have questions, it's ok to ask for clarification"". It will totally change the responses you get, and the effectiveness of your teaching.
I'm a doctor, and I frequently need to explain something to someone that I understand better than they do. It's very easy to forget that a patient who's just come to the hospital to have a baby may have only had 1 or 2 babies, while you have gone through the process of caring for a pregnant woman thousands of times. You may think it's just another normal day, but for them, this could be something they've never done.
I see my colleagues all the time fall into a trap where they use big words, don't explain things in terms their patients can understand, and then intimidate them away from asking questions.
No matter what it is you're explaining, remember that if you are the one teaching or explaining something, you're doing so because you know more than the person you are talking to, and so it's only natural they will have questions. A very simple change in how your phrase your statements will totally change the response you get.","LPT: When you finish explaining something, don't ask ""do you have any questions?"" ask ""what questions do you have?"""
LifeProTips,"You can't shut down a journal or a brand worth millions, however if you spread your hate about a thing, you will also spread this ""thing"", thus make them free bad publicity but still publicity, and making it grow even bigger.

""Bad publicity is still publicity"" is how modern journals make money, they make clickbait article designed to spark outrage so as to make people react and tweet about it for example, and then the tweet about the article will spark outrage even further, and the people seeing the tweet will probably continue the outrage chain by tweeting, retweeting or sharing to another social media, etc...

That's the reason why when the current U.S. President do or say something stupid it instantly shot up to the front page and you can't escape it for a few days/weeks, meanwhile the articles that aren't outrageous but report on important news get buried (unless it's something affecting so much people, that those people spread the word around on social media).

That's also the reason why (bad) reality TV make so much money, and once again the irony is that the more people complain about reality TV celebrities being famous for no reason, the more they'll be famous.

And that's also why brands now ""have"" political opinions (more like what a bunch of marketing guys thought would help the brand's image the most while also sparking ton of reactions), everyone has an opinion and politics are very divisive, so this is a perfect recipe for outrage between the people disagreeing with the brand and those agreeing, and all those social media post created in reaction will contain the name of brand, you've basically become the ad.","LPT: If you hate something and want it gone (as in not trendy/viral), don't voice your hate in disliking, downvoting or tweeting just ignore it and block it, because bad publicity is still publicity."

LifeProTips,"It is a tenant of CBT which is a therapy method that focuses on reconditioning automatic/common personal beliefs.

Just journal in the following format daily, with a new line for each situation that affected your mood:
Situation (what event happened)
Belief (what did you automatically think about yourself or your life etc when it happened)
Feeling (how did that make you feel emotionally)
Alternate belief (what productive belief could you have told yourself instead?)

I'll give an example:
Situation: I did not make it to the gym
Belief: I am lazy and worthless.
Feeling: Sad, despondent, disappointed
Alt. Belief: I needed to rest because I am human and in order to be healthy, humans need rest. I will pick it up again tomorrow and be better for it. 

If you're feeling down, give this a try for at least a week. You will be surprised how you start to notice your automatic negative beliefs... and in turn you can change them for the better. You can jot the bad and the good situations and truly begin to understand what beliefs are contributing to your current low esteem.","LPT: Feeling down a lot lately?

LifeProTips,"**Tip 1  Always plan your tasks ahead**

Solid planning with detailed tasks helps you kick off the day working immediately.

Here are some great ways to help you plan your tasks.

**- Plan the next day by the end of the current day**

Otherwise, you will waste a precious amount of time planning your day (which is a low focus activity) rather than working on your high focus activities.

**- Use a task management software**

Create a project board with 4 columns left to right: Todo, Doing, Done, Issues.

**- Break down your complicated tasks into smaller sub-tasks**

Nothing steals focus more than the stress caused by a combination of overwhelming tasks and difficulties to progress in your project.

To ensure you maintain a high level of focus, break every big task into minimal and easy to work on sub-tasks.

**Tip 2  Block all distractions and interruptions**

Distractions and interruptions, whether from direct contact or through digital means (phone, tv, email), kill your focus.

**- You must stay away from your phone and other digital devices**

Before starting your focused work, turn off your smartphone (or turn on the plane mode) and shut down other devices that can grab unnecessary attention. Example: TV, tablets, gaming consoles.

**- Only open the relevant tabs on your laptop**

If the internet is part of your focused work (most probably yes) then make sure to only open the tabs relevant to your focused work.  Social media tabs, chat applications tabs, are absolutely not OK. They must stay closed at all time during focused work sessions.

**Tip 3  Keep a clean and minimal workspace**

**- Workspace location**

Make sure your workspace is situated in a quiet location such as an office room in your house or a not too busy library floor.

**- Workspace Layout**

Ideally, your workspace should contain 4 items only: a table, a chair, your laptop, a big glass of water/coffee (to stay hydrated). That’s it.

Any additional items, such as books/magazines/food, can cause friction/distraction/disturbance and make it more difficult to start work straight away.

**Tip 4  Turn focused work into a daily habit**

Practice makes perfect. Focused work is an activity you should seek to perform on a daily basis.

Turn focused work into a habit. Here how you can achieve this.

**- Perform focused work at the same time every day**

I personally prefer doing focused work early in the morning before any other activity. 

**- Work in a series of intervals and breaks**

Break the work session into 4 intervals of 35 minutes. Each interval will have 30 minutes focused work plus 5 minutes break.

Taking these regular breaks of 5 minutes is super important, otherwise, you will burn out very quickly.

**- Update your project board at the end of every session**

Make sure your next focused work session always has a list of predefined tasks (back to tip 1). 

This way, you know exactly what is the plan for the next focused work session. Starting it will be a breeze.","LPT: 4 tips to increase your focus and get more things done. Plan ahead, block all distractions, set a minimal workspace, practice it daily."

People pick up things and habits and behaviour from their environment. 

As for an example, let's say people around you are body shamers and indulge in making body shaming jokes, then you'll sort of pick up the indulgence to feel more included and start doing it as well. 

You might end up hating the look of obese people (for example), even when you didn't originally have any such thoughts. 


This picking up of behaviour is sort of like the hive mentality. You see it even on Reddit. r/DownvotedToOblivion gives you some examples. 

Some people genuinely hate something, and people who are neutral likely pick up on it. 


If you find yourself hating something or disgusted by something, take a moment to think of why you actually hate it. Do you _really_ hate it? Or were you just neutral and picked it up? 

If it is some person, try putting yourself in their boots, and imagine yourself in their situation. 

You'll realise some times your hatred and disgust is totally unjustified. 


Doing this exercise will end up making you a lot more calmer and friendly person, and you'll start looking at many things in a much more positive way!","If you feel hatred towards someone/something, take a moment to think critically of why you hate them. Some of the hatred is unjustified."

I wish money was not a thing.

Do you remember when your grade school teacher asked you what you want to be when you grow up?

I want to be a military scientist. Starship Troopers movie (based from a character played by Neil Patrick Harris) inspired me to become one. Because I want to help the humanity in a way that I love. Science.
I am glad every time I see various test tubes, cylinders, beakers when I was a child and I just wanna buy them and conduct laboratory tests back home, but my parents can't afford it because we are poor back then.

Years after, realizing that I cannot really be a military scientist, I decided that I will become a doctor, a neurosurgeon to be exact or an environmentalist. Yet seeing my parents struggle to support my sister's education (she wants to become a nurse) and because of the future financial endeavour I'm seeing in the future, knowing that no one can support my ambition of obtaining a medical degree, I just compromised and accepted a scholarship to a merchant marine academy. Knowing that It's just a temporary gig for me and I can go back to medical profession anytime I want.

But after graduation, it has been hell of a ride, and by the time I know it, I'm already a ship's captain spending 10 months onboard and having only 2 months vacation every year for the past 6 years.

I've just only realized.
I cannot escape this career now. I'm afraid to go back to square one. I feel like that I'm already old to start over. I have missed my youth. And it really saddens me that I feel like I have not achieved my dreams even though I know I am still young -  yet I feel like I'm already dead.
I've chosen money over my personal dreams.
And I feel miserable everyday.

I cannot be a military scientist anymore and invent weapons that will save the humanity or a neurosurgeon who could help discover the cure to cancer. Seeing the devastating effects of climate change right now, I sometimes blame myself that I have not done my part for not being an environmentalist.
I just want to be the best version of myself and help humanity in some way.
But now I feel like it's too late.

I wish money was not a thing.
So we could all pursue our own passion and be happy like we used to be as a child, and somehow contribute to the development of the humanity.

To all the parents out there, support your child's passions no matter what it is. He/she could be someday's scientist, engineers, doctors, or even presidents that will help improve the world.

LifeProTips,"I have worked at the airport in marketing and route development for a while and originally posted this in r/digitalnomad subreddit where it got some positive feedback so I've decided to expand my original post with a few more tips (+ clarifying the ones already on the list). Enjoy!   


1. Be flexible on dates and times - I can't stress this enough, if you have a flexibility to shift your departure by a day or two, it means a lot, especially with business-like airports where Monday morning departures and Friday/Sunday returns can get pricey. The cheapest flights usually have stupid early or very late departures because the slots at the airport are the cheapest (Europe), in Asia though late nights are often very busy for carriers going back to Europe etc.
2. To the point above, some airports do have higher price fluctuations than others - so for example your Monday departure can be double the cost of a Wednesday one. This is mainly true for business-driven airports such as IAD (government), IAH (oil) etc. With hubs and airports with mixed profits, the fluctuations are less present - however some days might see much more departures than others due to scheduling.
3. Scan for nearby airports on both ends of your trip - especially true with LCC (low cost carrier) however take into a consideration the travel cost from the given airport to city centre.
4. Use multiple flight scanning tools - some routes and combinations work better on one site than the other. Try to use multiple such as Skyscanner, Kayak, Google Flights, Matrix ITA (before Google bought them over), Kiwi and Azair (which is great for Europe and European LCC). 
5. If you fly long-haul from/to Asia on Asian carriers, try using a VPN. It works in more cases but especially with Asian market where you can get lower prices connecting from an Asian country over a European/American one. Sometimes you might need to change the language/currency manually as well, in case the site doesn't correctly change it to the VPN location
6. If you fly primarily with legacy airlines and not LCC, try to make your way up in one of the alliances to gain perks - so check what airlines are in Star Alliance, One World and SkyTeam and see what airports are around you and work with that. Often it's worth to pay a little bit more for a flight within the alliance to build your FFP status rather than choosing a cheaper flight but with a difference alliance. Airlines/alliances also offer family accounts that can provide more perks and you should be able to ramp up your status more quicker. 
7. Also, to get more points and build up your FFP status, consider an airline/alliance partnered/issues credit card. You can get a lot of points just for sign up, for active use and even get some free flights on higher tiers. If you fly a lot, airline-partnered credit card can save you more money than a regular one with better cashback for example.
8. You don't have to clear your cookies when searching for flights. Doesn't work. That's not how airfare pricing works. Your local cookie doesn't affect a ticket price on an individual level. Overall, airlines provide certain number of tickets for certain prices for each flight. The pricing itself can be quite complex and consists of things like route's base fare, fuel price, airport slot price, date/time to departure, any promotions going on etc. 
9. If you have time and you are not fussed about short connections, check out airport's website to see what airlines operate from there and try to add a stopover or two to your itinerary, the route can get more complex but the pricing can go down. Flying direct saves a lot of trouble and it's more comfortable however if you add one or even two connections on long-haul, price can decrease quite a bit. You can always plan a day trip for those stop overs (visa permitting).
10. Open-jaw tickets can be real gems. Many airlines do not actively advertise open-jaw tickets because on certain routes they can work out fairly cheap comparing to classic return ones. This works well for neighboring countries for example if you plan to make a trip for example to India and Nepal or Indonesia and Malaysia etc. There are three main types of open-jaw tickets - destination open-jaw meaning where your return flight goes from another airport back to the original one - A&gt;B, C&gt;A, origin open-jaw - A&gt;B, B&gt;C or double open-jaw - A&gt;B, C&gt;D.
11. Alliances offer global/around the world tickets that can work out really cheap if you know your route and you can make it work with their planners. For example, check out One World and their [Explorer and Global Explorer](https://www.oneworld.com/world-travel) fares.
12. [SeatGuru](https://www.seatguru.com/) is your friend. When you book your ticket, checkout SeatGuru's guide for the given aircraft to know what seat you should check-in based on reviews, on a long-haul, this can make a difference.
13. If you want to travel on a specific type of an aircraft due to its quality, seating, noise level etc., you can use [Flightradar24](https://www.flightradar24.com) or a similar service to check historical flighting data for the given route to plan that and see what planes the airline normally operates on a given route.
14. Sign up to/follow multiple websites that list cheap flight deals and error fares and set up price alerts for different parts of the year so you don't miss out on any deals - [Fly4Free](https://www.fly4free.com/flight-deals/error-fare/), [Secret Flying](https://www.secretflying.com/), [Travel Pirates](https://www.travelpirates.com/), [Scott's Cheap Flights](https://scottscheapflights.com) etc.
15. [FlyerTalk](https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/trending.php) is your friend. Those guys are very knowledgeable and usually provide solid answers even to the most obscure questions.
16. If you haven't flown with the airline before and you want to know more about its performance, check out [SKYTRAX's website](https://www.airlinequality.com/) on airline reviews. Many people know their awards but they are also good if you need a deciding factor on a specific airline for the given route.

It was heavily advised that we brought business cards so I am in the process of making mine. Couple quick questions, should I put my university on the business card? If so should it be larger than the rest of the font but smaller than my name? Maybe in the color of my university? Should I list my major and both of my minors on the card? Should the back of the card be blank white or should I make it the color of the university or a logo, etc. Just looking for some advise from people who maybe look at business cards more than I do.",Help with business card

LifeProTips,"I love autopay but I rarely get to pick the day my bills (gas, electricity, internet, memberships, etc) are automatically deducted from my account. It was frustrating to have all these different autopay deductions from my checking account show up throughout the month. Now I just make one large prepayment to my credit card at the beginning of the month and have any bill payments automatically deducted from that credit card as the month goes on. This way I start off the month knowing my bills are paid off for the month and don’t even notice the little hits on my account because I already took one big hit at the start of the month.

They say to avoid using your credit card but in this case you’re actually pre-paying before anything gets spent on your card so as long as you pay what you know you’re going to owe in bills including paying down your credit card, you’re good. I called my bank to check and my credit card only charges interest on the total credit balance at the end of the billing cycle (not on new charges that are prepaid or paid off that same month) so this works for me without paying any extra interest. 

This trick may not apply to everyone but it has made paying bills much easier. If you don’t have a credit card, 0 credit balance (lucky you!) or pay by debit/check/etc. then an alternative is the envelope system which is also a great way to make paying bills more organized. (google: Dave Ramsey Envelope Bills System)

Side note: I know not all bills are payable with a credit card but it’s a lot easier to manage those few when the rest is taken care of. Also, yes I look forward to the day that I have 0 credit balance and I can no longer use this trick.

Don't be rude to the person who answers the phone or demand to talk to a mechanic, if you have a question let them get back to you, remember you wouldnt want them to stop working on your car to answer phone calls.  If you have to have emergency work and can't afford it tell the shop and if you're a good customer they may let you do payments. Bring them cookies at Christmas or slurpees on a hot summer day, maybe send a thank you card, trust me those little things go a long way, knowing our customers really appreciated us felt good and we went out of our way for those customers.  For the love of all that's holy DON'T stop by to talk to the mechanic about what you learned on the internet, to chat or pick their brains, they are trying to work and if you make a habit of bothering them you are going to be charged higher rates.

Like I said, your car is usually your most important asset after your home and most of us don't take care of them like we should, especially after the dealership freebies are done.

LifeProTips,"I see a lot of posts about people trying and failing to get approved for a loan for one reason or another because of bad credit or no credit history. Inevitably in the comments I see the OP saying that they ""have a credit card but don't use it because they're scary."" I felt the same way when I was younger before I understood how credit and credit cards really worked, so I thought I'd maybe help some people and dispel some of the fears around credit cards. 

The fear around credit cards comes from hearing all the nightmare stories about people tanking their credit when they were young and they're screwed for the rest of their life. And while that's definitely possible to do, it doesn't just happen out of nowhere on its own. Those people whose credit was ruined early in life saw that they had a $4000 credit limit on their card and didn't think what it would take to pay that off and just racked up a ton of debt. If you use a card wisely and stay within your means, credit cards can help you a lot now and especially down the road. 

First let's talk about how your credit works and how credit card companies make money off of you. Your credit is based on a lot of things in some weird formula that really nobody knows exactly. Essentially there's a thing called your debt to income ratio, which is literally how much debt you have total compared to how much money you make. There are some debts that are excluded in this for whatever reason, but this ratio is usually how creditors determine whether you get approved or what the terms of your loan are going to be. The messed up thing is that they, the credit companies, want you to have debt because people with no debt are somehow less appealing and I'm not sure why that is. Credit card companies want people to get their cards and use them a lot because they get a percentage of each purchase made with your card on the back end, and then they also make money off of the interest they charge the consumers. So your goal should be to use your credit card, have some small amount of ""debt"" each month that you're making good payments on (if it's something like a car or mortgage loan) or you're paying it off every month so as to bypass the interest, then you make more ""debt"" the next month and so on. 

If you have a checking account with a bank I would apply for a credit card through that bank, look for a card with good rewards and then see what happens. You won't get declined for having no credit or no credit history, credit card companies look to acquire new customers in young people and, in their eyes, take advantage of some of the people that misuse credit cards and rack up debt. But you, the smart consumer, can take advantage of this and build your credit positively. I would suggest going in to the bank and sitting down with an employee that can go over all the important details of a card i.e. interest rate, billing cycle, rewards, penalties and whatever else. Most Bank credit cards all have around the same interest rates, however some cards may have lower interest rates but no rewards, I would stay away from those as they are usually used for things like balance transfers or large purchases that you don't want to take a loan out for, but all that is a different conversation. 

So, you got approved, probably for like a $2000 credit limit, now what? Well, the big thing to keep in mind is how the interest rate applies to your purchases and paying your card off early. Basically, if you go to the store and buy something with the credit card there isn't any interest applied until the second month that the balance is on the card, meaning that if you buy something and pay it off every month you won't be charged interest and it's basically like paying cash, but you are building credit and also you get rewards points with most cards that can go towards gift cards and stuff. My suggestion would be to use your credit card in place of your debit card and then just pay off your credit card every month and you're good to go. People run in to problems when they use their credit card and don't pay it off every month and just make minimum payments. The minimum payments are set to benefit the credit card companies more than the consumer as they barely cover the interest, so essentially they're set to pay off the card in the longest possible time which causes you to pay a ton in interest, which is again where the credit card companies make their money. 

Finally, don't be afraid to apply for credit cards. People say that credit applications mess with your credit, and while that can be true if you're applying for seven cards a day, applying for one here and there won't negatively impact your credit after a short while. The only time you should definitely NOT apply for any new lines of credit is when you're applying for a mortgage, and your mortgage loan officer should tell you the same thing when you're going through the application. 

One thing I will caution everyone on is big box and retail store credit cards, so things like Best Buy or American Eagle or Walmart. On the surface they're the same as a bank credit card, but they always have these ""zero interest for X months"" promotions. These, again, can be used to your advantage if you do it right, but nobody at the store will tell you this and a lot of people get screwed because they didn't read the fine print on the card agreement during the application. Almost all retail stores have an interest rate on their card of upwards of %30, their promotions for no interest bypass that interest for the allotted time, but only if the balance is paid IN FULL by the end of the promotion time period, if you fail to do so you'll owe the interest for the entire promotional period even if you only owe like $10. So let's say you buy a $1200 TV from Best Buy and they offer a 0% interest for 12 months promotion if you use a Best Buy card. Obviously you should take it, but when you do just set automatic payments up for $101 per month to make sure that the balance is paid by the end of the 12 month period. You're essentially paying the same as you would if you just threw $1200 cash down and paid for it there, only it's spread out over 12 months, you build credit, and you kept that big chunk of money in your pocket. Win win.

All in all, new adults generally don't get educated about how to properly use credit to your advantage and it hurts them in the long run. I'm no financial guru but I have been through some stuff in my life that has taught me about these things. I went to buy my first car when I was 25 and I got shafter on the interest rate because I had no credit history. But, now a few years later I have a house and a car and a good credit score/history and some manageable debt that I make more than minimum payments on. Hopefully some of the stuff I learned can teach some of you how to use credit to your advantage and how to build it properly. Ask your parents or someone you know that is good with money to sit down and explain this stuff to you first hand if I did a poor job simplifying it, it's usually easier to digest when you see how these things work yourself.

LifeProTips,"I currently work with dual diagnosis (developmental delay + substance abuse) clientele, and in the past I have worked with clientele who have developmental delays with behavioural issues, mental health issues, etc.

A lot of people get into these fields because they want to ""make a difference"". That's fine and dandy, pretty respectable actually, but as someone who has been working in the field for a little while, it is not for everyone. This field has an insane turnover rate, and it's for a reason. Some of the issues I have seen in my jobs:

- Depending on the clientele, you will get attacked on the job, sometimes with weapons. Maybe even bodily fluids and shit thrown at you. Maybe attacked with a needle that contains traces of HIV positive blood. I'm not exaggerating. I used to get attacked with forks and butter knives every single shift.

- Pay is embarrassingly low at a lot of these jobs. They hook you in by saying you are ""making a difference"" while management makes at least 5x more than you for doing a lot less

- On that note, management is embarrassingly incompetent at a lot of special needs resources. I'm not generalizing, it is a widespread problem. Often the management cares more about the clientele than they do the staff, because the clientele bring in the funding. They will make you work in terrible conditions because they want to keep the terrible clientele. Because more funding = better paychecks for management.

- Often you'll be required to work overnights, or shitty hours. Some people dont care, but for some people this will affect the rest of their livelihood.

- Did I mention that you'll get attacked at these jobs? Yep, I did. Because it's important. Sometimes you'll be required to work with very, very bad people. Some of the clients I work with have tried to rape the female staff. One of our clients actually succeeded, they attacked and raped an overnight ""sleeper"" shift. Management then decided to fire the female staff because she forgot to put on the alarm, because they said she could have avoided being raped if she remembered to put the alarm on, so that she could have ran and hid. Yep, she was raped on the job, then fired for it. I dont know what happened to her but I hope she's doing well. And I hope she sued. I dont know the outcome, I left that job very quickly.

I could go on. I could write a book with the shit ive seen.

Long story short, you need to know whether you are physically and mentally capable of doing jobs like this. 

The best way to find this out in my experience is to volunteer. Mental health and developmental services are fields that are generally underfunded, so they will accept volunteers with open arms. 

Look into opportunities around you. Go in, meet the clientele, ask the regular staff how they like the field. Do this BEFORE spending tens of thousands on a degree in this field. 

On the flip side, I know many people who have been successful in this field and love their jobs. The shitty parts of the job dont get to them, and they look at the positives instead. Like knowing that your interventions helped improve the behaviour of a special needs individual, or helped reduce someone's drug addictions. There are a lot of positives, just be aware of the negatives.

This is just one way of establishing your authority while working in a corporate. There are obviously a lot of other ways that could be better than this. I'm not saying that this is the best method. Nevertheless, this method works and it will get you results pretty quickly.

Let's say that a previous manager quit and now you're managing his old team. You don't have much interaction yet but you want to establish authority on them.

One way to achieve this is to check the work that they're doing in detail. For example let's say you're a QA Manager and your team is updating incidents. Then you see their comments, check with the developers/support or whoever is involved in that incident whether the resolution provided is enough for them. You will sometimes find that they missed certain scenarios in the defect. You could point it out to them and request them to test out those additional scenarios as well.

Next, you check the emails that they send (ask them to include you on all emails). If they're talking about scenarios try to find some additional work that they could do along with whatever they're already doing. Either talk to the person in the ""To"" field and find out or use your own experience if you understand the product. Usually you'll find some additional work that could be done to increase the value. Reply back to the email and ask your subordinate whether he also performed the X activity. Request him to do it.

This establishes your authority for everyone in the ""To"" + ""CC"" fields. It also let's your new subordinates know that you're monitoring their work closely and they need to maintain a high level of quality.

LifeProTips,"&gt;**TL;DR:** disable in your email client the automatic image loading to prevent companies to track you.   
In Gmail you can do it through:  
Gmail -&gt; Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Images (Ask before displaying external images - This option also disables dynamic email.)

After taking a security course in our IT company, have learned one important lesson that thought it was nice to share. This risk is the ""smart"" spam and it's very easy to solve .

Many companies sells your data to other companies which later will bombard you with spam. A company can know many things from the actions you take on the emails.

For instance, when a spammer sends you an email, they can know if the email exists or not, but even worse when you open the email they can confirm that you are a real person and that your email account is active. They do this by using a pixel tracking technique; briefly... it's an image of one pixel size that is hosted in the spammer company server, when you open the image, you load it from their servers... this way they know you opened the email and you told them you have an active email account.

This might sound simple but it is not. One real example of this has happened to me. The company I worked for has 600 employees, some of these employees (including me) received spam from other software companies and opened these emails. The spammer company confirmed the email accounts, our company domain, tracked our company and started calling by phone to our employees and gave very accurate data of our employees, doing even worse a reverse engineering of the business and obtain sensitive data. This is why I said... not a simple thing.

In order to prevent this pixel tracking technique, you can enable in your email client a feature to prevent loading images automatically. 

In the case of Gmail, you can go to:

&gt;Gmail -&gt; Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Images (Ask before displaying external images - This option also disables dynamic email)

So I graduated in 2018 (I’m 20), and I initially wanted to go to Savannah State, and my mom talked me out of that and proposed the idea of me going to the Technical college where we live. I said okay, but I didn’t really want to go there. So, I eventually got accepted and I’ve been going there and living with my mom, I’ve had 2 or 3 jobs since going to school but currently I’m not working and she bought me a car for graduation. So over Christmas break I decided I wanted to transfer to a university but I couldn’t because they didn’t accept my classes, so my cousin goes to school an hour away from where we live and she was in the process of moving to where her school is, so my mom gave the idea of me moving there with her so I said okay and I applied for the school, and got accepted. Well, we found an apartment that we both liked and my cousins mom doesn’t have good credit so her dad used his information and we’ve been waiting for that to process for a while. Well my mom has always been “overprotective and controlling” and I hate that like I can’t even get a tattoo or go out like I want to, anyways now she’s saying she hopes we don’t get the apartment because the city we are going to be living, and she’s just been negative about the whole thing, and I’m starting to be afraid that we won’t get approved for the apartment.

LifeProTips,"Bonus points for something like an all-in-one pressure cooker as it will cut your time down on cooking.  Each meal-prep session will take a few hours, but you'll save yourself having to cook, you'll ensure portion control, you'll waste fare less food, and you'll save a fair bit of money.  

Vacuum sealed meals last up to a year in the freezer and have very little degrading in flavor.  In each cooking session it will take me and one other person \~1 hour shopping and 2-3 hours cooking/sealing to make between 40-50 meals.  Every 3 weeks on average I'll whip up something new, and it creates a good variety in the freezer.  This likely doesn't make as much sense for larger families, but for 1-3 people it's perfect.  We almost never throw away food.  This is not for people who don't like their foods touching!  Freezer space (such as a side-by-side freezer) is also a must.

You can reheat meals in the microwave that are vacuum sealed with a small hole cut in them and they won't get dried out, which is what kills reheating leftovers.  Letting the food thaw out in the fridge before helps ensure things heat up more evenly.  Thawed out meals can last up to 2 weeks in the fridge due to vacuum sealing.

You can get fairly cheap vacuum sealers for $30 on Amazon these days.  Vacuum bag will add \~$.10 onto each meal.

Here's some examples of what I do, I have \~15 recipes I cycle through to keep variety going.  High-protein, high-fiber, higher in good fats, and low sodium is what I aim for personally.

**Lunch/Dinner Example: Burrito Bowl**

**Cost:** \~$1.35

**Calories:** \~450-475

**Instructions:** Cook brown rice/chicken stock in pressure cooker on long-grain setting with 1.25 broth to 1 rice ratio (add garlic to taste). Please in fridge.  Add cumin and salt to beans in pressure cooker and cook \~30 minutes.  Remove all meat from Costco Chicken.  Sweet corn can be cooked on the stove with butter/Parmesan, but can also be added frozen.  Cut up onions desired thickness and fry in oil or butter.  Chicken can have flavoring added such as BBQ or Buffalo if desired. Vacuum seal and freeze each bag containing: 1/2 cup rice, 3oz chicken, 1/2 cup corn,  onions at a desired level and 1/3 cup black beans.  Move from fridge to freezer the night before you plan on eating the meal and microwave for \~2 minutes to prep.  

|Item/Serving size|Cost/Serving|Calories/Serving|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Brown Rice (\~1/2 cup cooked)|$.05|120|
|Costco Rotisserie Chicken (3oz)|$.45|145|
|Costco Sweet Corn (1/2 cup)|$.15|60|
|Chicken Stock (\~1/2 cup)|$.15|20|
|Onion|$.10|40|
|Black Beans (1/3 cup)|$.15-30|70|
|Salt/Cumin|$.05|0|

I made about 50-60 of these last time I made them for \~$70-$80.  

**Breakfast Example: Brown Sugar Banana Oatmeal**

**Cost:** \~$.60/serving

**Calories:** \~300

**Instructions:** Vacuum sealer not necessary, ziplock is fine... though vacuum sealing will increase how long they last.  Combine oats, cinnamon, sugar in bags ahead of time.  For a bit more calories/protein add your favorite nut.  Heat up water, add to mix and wait a minute.  Cut up banana and add on top before serving.  These meals last \~3-6 months.

|Item|Cost/Serving|Calories|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Rolled Oats (1/2c)|$.2|160|
|Cinnamon (to taste)|$.05|0|
|Brown Sugar (1 tbsp to taste)|$.05|35|
|1 Medium Banana (or other fruit)|$.30|100|

Soon enough everything starts to change

They try take your future and make it real safe  
You could be a doctor accountant or something sane  
What ever happened to the sky was the limit?  
I fell in love with music never thought it was a gimmick  
I worked so hard on every tune and every single lyric  
My whole identity dependent on being artistic

Now you want to strip that away?  
So you feel ok?  
Cuz if I make it to the top what does that really say?  
That you shouldn't have given up, that you made the mistake  
But if I fail you feel much better bout pickin' your lane right

And let's be honest life's a competition  
So if I'm going to play then I'm gon play to win it  
I refuse to sit and rot at a desk all day  
Unless I have a passion I'm working towards ok

Id rather be dead on the outside than inside  
A bullet to the head than 25 to life  
In a cubicle alone just trying get by  
Building someone else's dream instead of building mine

If you're hearin' me this is meant to inspire  
If you have a dream or if you have desires

Go fight for her man go die for her man

One chance to prove it to yourself so don't lose it  
You got this fam just keep pushing on through it

LifeProTips,"**GROWING UP, I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY I WAS THE BLACK SHEEP IN MY FAMILY..**

Both my parents were academic. 

My father was a scientist, my mother a journalist. My older sister became an architect.

I found school uninspiring and didn’t really apply myself. I did enough to get by.

I really just enjoyed playing football (soccer), kayaking, judo, swimming, cycling and long distance running.

Looking back on my life, I suppose growing up I was really keen to make my parents happy. 

As a result, I chose a path in life that was based on what I thought others expected of me (both by my family and society) 

The subjects I studied at 17 or 18 years old were based on what my father considered to be ‘appropriate’ or ‘suitable’ and as a result, I found it really difficult to pay attention and really commit to studying.

It was the same story when I went to University. I really just went because that is what I thought I was supposed to do.

I therefore didn’t have much enthusiasm and I felt massively unfulfilled and this would continue throughout the next 15 plus years of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

**BY 17 OR 18 YEARS OLD, I HAD PRETTY MUCH ABANDONED SPORT AND STARTED SMOKING WEED DAILY..**

Soon enough, I became partial to a ‘wake and bake’ and would indulge in ‘hippy speedballs’. 

I would miss class, smoke weed in lunch break and before exams.

Once I had graduated and was working, I continued to smoke weed most days. 

Over time, I found myself in bars three or four times a week and developed a weekly cocaine habit (London is the Cocaine capital of Europe).

I was bouncing around aimlessly, I was uncertain and indecisive; with no clear vision of what I wanted for my life. 

Reflecting on my life to date, I have worked in a whole host of different jobs; I’ve done graveyard shift litter picking after festivals, worked in retail, as a waiter, for charities, community centres, social enterprises, NGOs, branding agencies and tech agencies.

I’ve been sacked, made redundant or the funding for my role ran out. The last role I had, the company went into liquidation. 

By this time, I realised that this was not a coincidence. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I BECAME FRUSTRATED, WAS IN SELF DOUBT AND DIDN’T KNOW WHERE TO GO. I SLUMPED INTO AN ‘UNEMPLOYMENT DEPRESSION’..**

There was a pattern emerging here. I found myself in this constant cycle of working in jobs that didn’t fulfil me.

I asked myself a series of questions

* Was I really supposed to just get another job that I hated and continue resenting my life?
* Was I really just supposed to get a job, so I could get paid, perhaps get a mortgage? 
* And go on the occasional holiday?
* Is this what life was really about? 

I was depressed at being unemployed, but equally depressed at the thought of returning to work in an industry that left me unmotivated and uninspired.

Inside, I knew I was capable of something. I just didn’t know WTF it was...

I continued applying for jobs, had interviews and was rejected each time.

&amp;#x200B;

**AFTER A FEW MONTHS, I STOPPED LOOKING..**

My attention slowly began to focus in a new direction. 

I had stumbled across this guy called Dandapani on Youtube (he’s a Hindu priest, philosopher and spiritual coach who works with athletes and CEOs in the US). 

I watched a video of his and he said “do not seek happiness, pursue a life were the byproduct is happiness.”

This really resonated with me. This is what I needed to do.

I wanted this life where the byproduct was happiness.

I remember being in my flat and brainstorming:

* What are the three or four most important things to me?
* What kind of life or lifestyle would make me happy?
* If I could build this life or lifestyle, what would it look like?
* How would it make me feel?
* I proceeded to redefine my life. 

I simplified my life and focused all my time and energy on the three or four key things that really mattered to me. 

My physical and mental wellbeing was top of that list. 

I resumed the things I loved doing in my youth.

I started running again, I took up yoga and was kickboxing four times a week (I later entered a kickboxing competition). 

The kickboxing competition put me in a situation where I needed to do everything within my circle of influence (a reference from the Stephen Covey Book - The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People) to ensure I didn’t get the sh\*t kicked out of me. This was one of a handful of book that really provoked changes in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

**HAVING THIS CHALLENGE IN FRONT OF ME MADE ME STOP DRINKING, SMOKING AND TAKING DRUGS..**

I noticed the significant improvements in me and I never went back to drinking, smoking to taking drugs after that.

I became increasingly curious and developed a real passion for learning and reading. 

With the time I had, I began reading more. An interest in psychology, philosophy and personal development emerged organically.

I expect part of this was because I was doing things on my terms and I was doing things that interested me for a change.

Initially I said I would give myself three months off but my period of unemployment lasted about ten months.

&amp;#x200B;

**I SPENT THE MONEY I HAD SAVED SINCE THE AGE OF 21 - IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN THE DEPOSIT FOR A MORTGAGE..**

It was tens of thousands of pounds.

Some people would have considered that a waste of money (my father was one of them). 

From the outside he saw me unemployed for all that time and assumed I was wasting my life away. 

To me, it was the best investment I could have made with my life.

That money bought me time. I used that time to invest in myself which enabled me to discover and develop my passion.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WAS WILLING TO SACRIFICE EVERYTHING IN ORDER TO FIND MY TRUE PURPOSE IN LIFE..**

I realised that possessions, a house, money, holidays and material things meant nothing to me unless is was totally fulfilled.

My savings were depleted but I had achieved the fulfilment and happiness that Dandapani had spoken of and had started to take control of my life.

I’d abandoned my self destructive lifestyle, moved away from toxic people. I had truly redefined who I was.

I now found great comfort in my own company. I spent my time meditating, reflecting on life and in the company of books.

Having made this transition, I asked myself 

* How can I earn an income from this lifestyle?
* How could I make enough money to survive doing the things I love?

I looked back on my past and what I was doing with my life. 

It made sense to me to retrain as a personal trainer and pursue a career in personal development as a life coach.

This would give me the opportunity to help others to achieve the results they want to see both in their personal and professional lives.

I realised that it would be difficult in the sense that I was starting again from scratch (I would have no contacts and no clients in the industry and would be on an entry level salary if I worked in a gym).

But I looked back on my past and reflected on how I would look on this in the future.

This was a unique opportunity for me to finally pursue my truth.

I had also come to the realisation that money meant nothing unless I was totally fulfilled.

At that point, I realised I needed to take the jump..

Looking back on this period of unemployment, I realised there were specific things that I did almost unconsciously that helped me get out of the depression that I experienced. 

I thought to myself there must be others going through this so put together a [short video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyke9i20fFA&amp;feature=youtu.be) with the different tips / techniques that I used to help me get out of unemployment depression.","LPT Request - How I quit drugs, bounced out of an unemployment depression, developed my passion and took steps to earn a living doing what I love - Tips and resources to help others"

LifeProTips,"Little back story, I finished my first associates degree back in 2013. I had gotten a degree in auto body mechanics, an A.O.S career degree which later I learned is just a fancy way of labeling an over priced trades program. So almost no credits transferred. Another thing I did not know at the time, was there is a cap on how many credits you can take before financial aid cuts you off. I was taking CNC machining courses on top of the degree program to give myself a 2nd option.

2 years down the road I moved to a different state and wanted to take courses in 3D animation and modeling. After going through the enrollment process, all the advisor meetings, getting a schedule set etc. the Friday before classes start I get called into the financial aid office. Even though my FAFSA said I was eligible for enough people money to cover the tuition, I was told that I had exceeded the credit hour limit. 

Stubbornly determined next semester I tried at a different university. Same thing happened just before classes started.

I pretty much gave up on returning to college after this and realized I was stuck working my way up in what ever companies I could get my foot in the door with. I moved back to my home town, when I read a news article talking about how a man put all his kids through college by working as a janitor at a college. Lightbulb moment.

A little over a year of checking into the local colleges job postings and waiting for any position I would meet the minimum qualifications for, a cleaner position came up. I applied and after a brief interview I was offered the job.
