LifeProTips,"I’m a Sales Manager of a busy Volvo dealership and I couldn’t count how many times a customer comes into my dealership after buying a car online because it’s £5-£20 a month cheaper and doesn’t know how to do something.  

Cars are getting more complicated, with a lot of manufacturers focusing on the development of hybrid/electric engines, infotainment systems and safety features becoming more advanced.  Most people need to be shown how to make the most out of their new car and exactly what it’s capable of.

After you’ve bought your car online, you could go to a dealership and ask to be shown how to use it, but we aren’t making money whilst we show you how to use your car.  To succeed in car sales you need to be focused on trying to sell a car at all times, showing you how to use your new car isn’t going to make us any money so we don’t really want to spend the time doing it.  Now I’m not an awful person, neither are my sales team, but we will make it quick and certainly don’t care as much as you’re not one of our customers.

Not to mention if your car goes wrong! Picture this - you’re on your way to work and your car comes up with a warning light. You bring it in and my service department are fully booked, can’t look at your car today and don’t have a courtesy car to give you.  You’re stuck.  Now if you bought the car from me and my team, even if it was 4/5 years ago, I would bend over backwards to keep you on the road and able to go to work, I’d probably lend you my company car for the day/find an unused demo to let you borrow.

You’re more than welcome to bring in the quote you’ve received online, we’ll genuinely do our best to match the quote but 99% of the time it will be a little bit more expensive.  Brokers work from an office, sometimes even from home, with a computer and a phone.  We have to pay for a showroom amongst a lot of other things.  But we will talk you through your purchase in a lot more detail, we work for one brand and know it inside out, they sell every manufacturer under the sun and expect you to come to them with exactly what you want.  We will also show you how to use your car in as much detail as you require and will do everything we can to keep you happy, at the end of the day we end up building a relationship together. Brokers want nothing to do with you after you’ve bought the car.

A **silent disco** is an event where you put on a special pair of noise-canceling headphones and gather with others who have done the same. Then, as individuals, you can tune into one or multiple channels of sound, while simultaneously and indirectly combining energies with those around you.

People need to move a little bit and feel good while still have a sense of belonging. Syncing music is tough with connection and everything. Maybe groups of friends can log on and have a Google Hangout or something where everyone can mute their microphones but can still watch friends totally having the time of their lives and just sharing energy. Families, friends, couples, whatever. Go do it. No need to worry about being in the same beat or whatever. Just have fun.

LifeProTips,"In this trying time, it is easy to let the mind imagine all kinds of terrible things, some which may come to pass, and some which may not. Remember that these fearful imaginings are painful. You are feeling them, as is everyone else. When you feel an icy cold grip your mind, practice compassion and mentally cradle other people feeling the same pain you are. You can be kind and afraid at the same time, and even the smallest kindness will mean so much to someone else: a gentle encouragement, an act of service for someone in need, a kind word of praise and acknowledgement. When the darkness falls, what the world needs most is light.","LPT: When you're scared and anxious, practice empathy and compassion"

2. Go to ""Status"" on the left hand side of the options menu
3. Increase the minutes timer in both the ""Show me as inactive when my computer has been idle for this many minutes:"" and ""Change my status from Inactive to Away after this many minutes"" categories.

LifeProTips,"I work IT, we've been working like crazy getting all of our clients set up for working remotely from home. All of us are, likewise, working from home.

It can be a little challenging to self-isolate and still be productive, but something I've found is that I am definitely far more productive with my day if I keep up with basic, every day kinds of routines:

* **Get dressed**: Even if it's not your full work get-up (like a suit and tie) putting on a good pair of pants, a good shirt, and shoes can put you into the work mindset from the beginning. It might be tempting to work in sweatpants and slippers, but try getting ready in the morning like you normally would and see if it helps you stay focused.
* Eat at scheduled times: Even though the fridge is *right there*, try to maintain a strict breakfast/lunch time as if you were still at the office. This is good for both productivity and your waistline.
* If you can, seclude yourself and stay away from the TV: I have an office in my home and we do not have a TV in it for a reason. It's a quiet place where I can close the door and focus on my job, even if others are home. If it's not possible, just avoid turning on the TV or put on a music channel or app like Pandora. Just avoid watching anything that you find interesting or even have to look up from your computer to absorb.

It's going to be weird for a lot of us for a while, but I think if we keep to routines we can stay productive and not go *completely* insane. Also, make sure to text/call/facetime with people.

LifeProTips,"I remember when I was in middle school and high school, I often yearned for the days when I was in elementary school and thought about how great it would be if I could go back to those days; the days when grades didn’t really matter like they did in high school, and if you got in a little bit of trouble, it was probably no big deal.

After I graduated high school and had a regular full time job, I longed for the days when I was still in school and wished I could go back.  Remember how nice it was to not have any real responsibilities?  As long as your homework was done, the rest of your life was yours to do whatever you pleased.  And every year, you had three solid months off school to do anything you wanted.  You could stay up late every night, sleep in as long as you wanted, and had no real adult responsibilities.  I would give anything to go back to those days for just one year.

After I got married,  and my wife and I bought our first house, we often reminisced about the good old days when we were single.  We could just date each other, we still lived at home, so our parents took care of a lot of things for us, we had no homeowner responsibilities like worrying about making the mortgage payment or mowing the lawn every week, and the world was our oyster; we could do practically anything that we could afford.

Now I’m in my late 30’s (although my body feels like it’s in its late 50’s), and the cycle repeats itself.  We have two kids (one with special needs), a mother-in-law with health issues living in our basement, and life is crazy chaotic.  I spend my nights in bed, wishing I could go back 7 years when we had no kids.  (Don’t get me wrong, I love my kids to death and wouldn’t trade them for anything!)  It was so nice when all we had to do was take care of the house, and we actually had the TIME TO DO IT!  We both had decent jobs (my wife stays home now), so we could do a bit of small-time traveling.  Once all the chores were done, we could go out to dinner or see a movie whenever we pleased.  Life was so much simpler then.

I’m sure in 10 or 15 years, I’ll be laying in bed, wishing I could go back to the 2020’s.  Yeah, it sucked with that stupid Corona virus that everyone thought would be the end of the world, but we got through it.  Yeah, we had some real struggles when the mother-in-law moved in and we thought that period would never end, but at least then I had good health and could put on my socks and shoes without using a special tool that I bought off TV.  At least then I still had both kidneys.  At least then both of my kids were alive and healthy.  At least then I still had my parents that I could go to for advice.  At least then I was surrounded by loving neighbors who would help me if and whenever I needed them, even during the middle of the night.

I guess my point is this:  right now, while you have the foresight that at some point in the future, you’ll probably look back on this time and wish you could go back to it, make sure you thoroughly enjoy today.  Maybe even consider journaling regularly so that if you ever question whether or not you wasted your time, you’ll have physical proof that you savored these days, and maybe it will put your mind at ease.","LPT: Whatever stage of life you’re in, be sure to take time to thoroughly enjoy it, and reflect often on what you have going for you."

LifeProTips,"Hi I am a refugee, and now I am in a refugee camp. (I want to warn that I do not speak English very well) I understand that no one likes to listen to other people's problems. All people have enough of their worries. I think that we are born and die alone. This is normal, but nevertheless I will now try to describe my feelings. I'm not mature yet. (I don’t know if this is important.) I had to leave Ukraine (Crimea) with my parents because of political problems. Together with my family, I felt a danger to our life, because of our political views, so we decided to leave. Well, now, when I write this, we have already received several answers (refusals) from an organization that deals with refugee issues in the country in which I am now. Since, in their opinion, Ukraine is recognized as a safe country. And everyone around us says that for us it is impossible (or very difficult) or there is practically no chance to stay. But I understand that if we return, then at best, my father will be imprisoned. And it’s not clear what will happen to my mom. You see, parents are the most important thing for me in this world. I am ready to give my life for them. My mother always taught me that I should be strong, and always supported me. There are billions of people on the planet, but only two people in this world love me this My Mom and my father, and now I understand that I can lose them, and this is an unbearable feeling. And it really scares me, I don’t know what will happen to us tomorrow, I don’t know what to do, all the time I have terrible thoughts in my head, I dream of suicides every night. I would now give everything for the opportunity to stay in this country and just live in peace. Many teenagers of my age now have problems for example (how to take a test at school next week or how to invite Jessica on a date). And I just want my parents and I to have a quiet life. And now I want to urge you that everyone who reads this will realize that you need to appreciate every minute of your life.

Here's what I learned:
1) Hold fast to whatever is waiting for you on the other side. It doesn't matter it feels foolish, or whether there is certainty of it happening exactly as you plan in the end. Hope can deliver us from the darkest of days.
2) Be goofy AF. Crack jokes. Be odd. Let your mind wander when it needs to. You need to let that pent up energy out often. Channel it into whatever creative nonsense you can think of.
3) Food is fuel. Eat what you need, but ration the good stuff. You'll need the good rewarding pick-me-ups spaced out in time.
4) Make a time-keeping record / log. Put all your thoughts, poems, songs, rants, etc in it. Bonus if you can collaborate on it with others.
5) Share your thoughts with others and commiserate often. We are all in the suck, and it doesn't matter how much worse anyone has it. Your feelings are valid, and need acknowledgement.
6) Write letters to loved ones, and record videos for them to watch (and facetime now that that tech is available). I always felt special when someone went to the trouble of making something like that for me, and letting me know they care. And I felt good making them too.
7) Have a project. Something long term that you have to work on gradually. Education, making, hobby, art, etc.
8) Make and share playlists for your various moods, and embrace the moods you feel fully. Get all the joy, rage, pain, and everything out. Scream if you need to. Don't worry about looking crazy, because the World is crazy, and we are a reflection of it.
9) Get to know people that you would never talk to in your normal routine. They will change your life.
10) Reward your accomplishments. Because you are a survivor, thrill hunter, a champion, and a badass.
11) Be a dick as little as possible, and share whatever you can.",LPT Advice on managing extended periods away from the World

LifeProTips,"These days finding an alcohol based desinfectant may be difficult. In which case you can use normal household bleach instead. You probably already have some at home. 

**Bleach is a strong and effective disinfectant – its active ingredient sodium hypochlorite is effective in killing bacteria, fungi and viruses, including influenza virus – but it is easily inactivated by organic material. Diluted household bleach disinfects within 10–60 minutes contact time. Stronger concentrations act faster.**

Most household bleach solutions contain 5% sodium hypochlorite. 

1:100 dilution of 5% sodium hypochlorite is the usual recommendation. 

**Use 1 part bleach to 99 parts cold tap water (1:100 dilution) for disinfection of surfaces.**

*Adjust ratio of bleach to water as needed to achieve appropriate concentration of sodium hypochlorite. For example, for bleach preparations containing 2.5% sodium hypochlorite, use twice as much bleach (i.e. 2 parts bleach to 98 parts water).*

**Preparation**

* use a mask, rubber gloves and waterproof apron; goggles also are recommended to protect the eyes from splashes;

* mix and use bleach solutions in well-ventilated areas;

* mix bleach with cold water (hot water decomposes the sodium hypochlorite and renders it ineffective);

* Use 1 part bleach to 99 parts cold tap water

**Use**

* Apply to doorknobs, faucets, floors, bathroom surfaces,   food preparation surfaces

* Personal items like phones, keys, jewelry, loose change, cards (but not paper money)

* Keyboards, mice, earbuds etc. including their cables

* Soak a door mat or an old towel with the solution and keep your shoes on it. 

* Items should remain in contact with bleach solution for at least 10 minutes. 

**Desinfection of toys and other items for kids**

* Boil some water in order to sterilize it and wait until it cools to room temperature.

* Desinfect toy by rubbing or soaking in bleach solution for 1 hour.

* Rinse thoroughly with prepared sterile water.

**Precautions:**

* Bleach can corrode metals and damage painted surfaces.

* Avoid touching the eyes. If bleach gets into the eyes, immediately rinse with water for at least 15 minutes, and consult a physician.

* Do not use bleach together with other household detergents, because this reduces its effectiveness and can cause dangerous chemical reactions. For example, a toxic gas is produced when bleach is mixed with acidic detergents, such as those used for toilet cleaning, and this gas can cause death or injury. If necessary, use detergents first, and rinse thoroughly with water before using bleach for disinfection.

* Undiluted bleach emits a toxic gas when exposed to sunlight; thus, store bleach in a cool, shaded place, out of the reach of children.

* Sodium hypochlorite decomposes with time. To ensure its effectiveness, purchase recently produced bleach, and avoid over-stocking.

* If using diluted bleach, prepare the diluted solution fresh daily. Label and date it, and discard unused mixtures 24 hours after preparation.

* Organic materials inactivate bleach; clean surfaces so that they are clear of organic materials before disinfection with bleach.

* Keep diluted bleach covered and protected from sunlight, and if possible in a dark container, and out of the reach of children.

If you go to your bank account portal, there should in general be some sort of help desk or chat bot. Like an actual chat box.

If they do have it, say you want to dispute a transaction, and specify that you can’t go because of the virus (and give any specific evidence as necessary). You’ll need to have info on when you contacted them, how long you’ve been waiting, when you expect to hear back, etc.

This should work.

If your bank doesn’t have an automated chat portal, then call them, saying you need to dispute a charge.

If you have to pick a class, it honestly doesn't matter which subject, especially if you're undecided.

In the wake of Coronavirus (COVID-19) and persistent measures to ensure safety for the public, select pharmacies are offering free prescription medication deliveries to help patients practice social distancing while still accessing their medications.

CVS and Walgreens Make Access to Prescriptions Easier Nationwide
CVS and Walgreens, including Walgreens-owned Duane Reed, announced last week they would be waiving delivery fees on eligible prescription medications.  

Neither retailer offers delivery on controlled substances or refrigerated medications. 

You must have an active prescription with your local CVS,  Walgreens or Duane Reed to participate in the free delivery option. If you need to transfer your prescription, you can ask your healthcare provider to move it or you can transfer it yourself. Be sure to give your RxSaver coupon information to the pharmacist via phone to ensure you receive a discount on your prescription.

H-E-B &amp; Free Delivery on Prescription Medication for Specific Texas Areas
Texas-based grocery retailer, H-E-B is offering free delivery on prescription medications for most Texas residents. Similar to Walgreens and CVS, all you need to do is call your local H-E-B and schedule your Rx for at-home delivery. Be sure to give your RxSaver coupon information to the pharmacist via phone to ensure you receive a discount on your prescription.

Check with your local H-E-B to ensure delivery is available for your prescription and your store at this time. 

What additional pharmacies are offering for rx delivery
While the above retailers are offering free delivery on prescription medications, other national retailers provide delivery services, depending on your medication order. 

Walmart Prescription Medication Delivery Options
Walmart currently offers free standard shipping on prescription medication deliveries. You can either send in a paper mail order form or call their direct line to speak to a Walmart pharmacy rep and get your medications sent directly to your door.

Walmart offers free delivery on standard shipping and select pricing on rush order options. Be sure to call your local Walmart for specific information on your prescription medication and delivery options.

Rite Aid Prescription Medication Delivery Options
Rite Aid offers delivery of prescription medications at select Rite Aid pharmacy locations. 

Use the Rite Aid store locator to determine if your local Rite Aid offers free prescription delivery in your area.

If Rite Aid is your preferred pharmacy and does not offer prescription medication delivery, be sure to utilize their pharmacy drive-thru to practice social distancing while still picking up your medication.

If your local Rite Aid does not have a drive-thru option, Rite Aid recommends placing your Rx order through the Rite Aid app so you are alerted when your prescription is ready for pick-up. This saves you time waiting for your prescription in line at the store and limits interaction at the pharmacy counter.

Kroger Prescription Medication Delivery Options
Kroger Health offers Sync Up which allows patients to fill multiple medications at once. Instead of having to rely on multiple trips to your Kroger pharmacy, your medications could be filled for a one-time pick-up.  This program also allows direct access to pharmacists for any specific questions you have about your medication.

Frequently Asked Questions About Free Prescription Delivery
What does this prescription delivery mean for me and my medication?
If you have a monthly medication or need to fill a new medication, you can utilize free Rx delivery options where available to receive your medications straight to your front door.

If you need to transfer your prescription or you are filling a new prescription, ask your healthcare provider to call or send it electronically to the pharmacy of your choice.  

Can I still use my RxSaver prescription coupon and have my prescription delivered?
Yes. Please call your local pharmacy and speak directly to the pharm tech or pharmacist to use your RxSaver on your prescription.  The pharmacist will ask for the coupon information over the phone, so make sure you have your RxSaver coupon or prescription savings card ready.  

Once the pharmacist confirms the coupon via phone, the medication will be processed for delivery.

What if prescription delivery is not available to me?
If your rx cannot be delivered you can still utilize your pharmacy’s drive-through window for a safe and easy pick-up. 

You can always use your RxSaver coupon at the drive-through window by visiting our website and printing out your coupon before heading to the pharmacy. Be sure to click ‘Print Coupon’ on the coupon page. 

If prescription delivery isn’t available, you may also utilize programs like Sync Up to ensure all your medications are filled at the same time for one easy pick-up instead of planning multiple trips.

You can also ask your healthcare provider to fill a 90-day supply of your medication instead of only a 30-day supply. 

Or you can make the switch to HealthWarehouse and order your medications directly online and shipped to your home.

LifeProTips,"It's always going to be awkward when you interact with people from different cultures and you come across names that you haven't seen and don't know how to pronounce. Some people may feel especially pressured to get it right, and inadvertently become defensive if they get it wrong. In going through this mental rollercoaster, remember to be considerate to the person you are interacting with and don't make it about yourself.

An example of a typical awkward interaction might be:

&gt;Is it...T-ang or Th-ang? T-ang Bah-wee or...Boi? That's a pretty hard name to pronounce. I don't know many people from Burma and it's strange to me. And, you know, I grew up in the southern US, so we don't get a lot of people like you here, and you know how we speak...

Here's the thing: people with foreign names are used to it. You're probably not the only person *that day* who has mispronounced it. They'll have their own way of rolling with it, such showing how to pronounce it, or offering an alternative name. Let them decide how to progress instead of digging yourself into a corner.

I don't expect people to get my foreign name correct (I'd be surprised if they did nail the pronunciation). Having grown up in an English-speaking country, I'm used to the Anglicised version of the pronunciation and I'm happy to teach people how to say it properly if they really want to know. But I don't need to be told how it should be pronounced according to you or why you don't know.

LifeProTips,"My biggest concern for myself and my friends right now is an adjustment to a lifestyle that is both foreign and counter-intuitive. We all love a vacation from life but what happens when that vacation never ends?  So I thought I’d post short thoughts daily, in an attempt to help you (and me) keep sane and healthy these next few weeks.

Today’s thought is kind of obvious - get dressed!  Just like your bedroom should be for sleeping and sleeping only (funtimes excluded), your pjs should be worn for sleep only.  Wearing your pjs gives your body the cues that it’s time to power down.  If you never take them off, your body and brain may never power up.  Being awake and ready to be active in your life is key, no matter where life is happening.

Basically, outside, your residency, the shop store, almost everywhere you go, there's doors! And doors can be opened by random people, or your closest ones. Therefore in this time of vigilance, you must do anything in your power to avoid picking the virus and/or contaminating people.

The following, are mini-guides to open doors depending on its type, helping you keep your hands from touching it.

Reminder: At the first occasion, wash your hands with soap or use a hydroalcoholic gel, and these tips below are to make it home safe without touching your face.

&amp;#x200B;

* Using a **door with a knob**: is like handshaking a dozen of people that came there before you, thus dangerous. *How to avoid that?* Use your forearm and pull down from the side. If it's hard to open, then use the back of your other hand or the other forearm, and pull on the contrary sense. (It's so obvious, yet some might not be aware of it)
* Using a **door with a handle**: same as the knob's effect, so you have to avoid touching it with your hand. *How to avoid that?*  Your elbow is there for you! And push with your forearm, but if it's a pull door, then elbow + the palm of your hand to pull.
* A **door with the bar lock**: Usually used for exiting and emergency doors, intuitively calling you to use your hand, and push to open. *How to avoid that?* Your hips! A little side move to unlock and push the door. If it's too high, use your shoulder or back, same concept! The doors that you have to pull with that kind of lock have usually a sort of handle ( like [this](https://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00SgdRcKrsMvqo/Industrial-Heavy-Duty-Glazed-Exterior-Interior-Galvanized-Steel-Single-Leaf-Powder-Coating-Security-Steel-Safety-Door.jpg) ) can be easily opened with the back of the hand, or one door goes in, the other goes out (use the one you can push, much easier).
* **Pushable door with no handle**: have usually a flat surface that tells you to ""push"", and you instinctively push from there. *How to avoid that?* Use the side of your fist at the highest point you can touch of the door, where usually no one touch, or even your foot if your hands are full. If it's hard to open, then use your shoulder, forearm, or back to open it.
* **Sideway door** (not the automatic ones, duh!): might look tricky, but actually easy. *How to avoid that?* If it got a knob or a handle, same concept as the two first guides. If a small sliding handle, your elbow is there! If none of that and got just an opening where you're supposed to use your hand? Then don't! Use your foot instead: tilt it 90° to your outside, try and insert your foot in between the two doors or the door and the wall, and then push! (same guide can be applied to eat ass!)

I know it might sound silly, but who knows, that can save your life, or the other's. And if you have other doors models I didn't cover, feel free to comment it, and I'll edit the post (all credits due to you, kind stranger!)

Between people not able to work, liquor stores and bars closing, and the ability to go to rehab ""under the radar"" we've noticed a spike in interest in treatment. What we've also learned is that most of the time these patients are filing for short term disability which will help them cover losses from wages or tips depending on what they did for a living. Then when this all blows over they come back to work sober and better than ever. 

So while this might not be a LPT for all, this could help quite a lot of people. If you know someone that needs help please share these thoughts with them. Happy to answer any questions anybody might have.","LPT: if you've been struggling with addiction now is a great time to get to rehab.

I work in a lab with about 35-40 people. I can't tell you what we do... but I can tell you it does relate to viruses. Anywho one of my co-workers Sarah (not real name) has a teenage daughter with leukemia. Needless to say having a kid with leukemia is extremely financially draining. Even with a well paying job Sarah and her partner still struggle time to time. They are able to afford treatments... but they really don't get to do anything more expensive than a trip to the movies. 

Some of us thought it would nice to start of the spring by going out as a company to enjoy eating out at a pretty nice hibachi restaurant... all expenses paid and you could bring your family.  We also thought it would be nice to give Sarah a few gifts as it was a few days before her birthday. Nothing too over the top just a nifty thing here and there. And then Sarah picks up a letter.  In that letter is a scratch off ticket... and Sarah scratches and see's that she just won $100,000 dollars. Needless to say she burst into tears about how much it was going to help her family that they could finally take trips and replace their car which was starting to act up.

When a one of the managers decided to reveal with a chuckle. Yah that ticket wasn't real. It was a fake prank ticket. You could tell by the back corner of the ticket in small print.

Needless to say that manager no longer works in the company and sarah well let's just say she took two weeks vacation; and I wouldn't be surprised if she doesn't come back.

Delaying gratification is to resist the temptation of immediate pleasure and wait for bigger rewards in the future. It turns our ability to delay gratification plays a huge role in our money success. 

For example, by cutting down money spent on coffee shop coffees, you can save up and buy an awesome expresso machine. It makes amazing coffee at home and can save you money for years to come. If you cook more and eat less takeout, you can then save the money for a trip or put it towards buying your own home. Delayed gratification is helpful because by saying no to small temptations every day, you are preparing yourself for something bigger and better! 

Secondly, the most important reason that delayed gratification is great for your money is that money grows with time! Your money is a seed with the potentials to grow. When you put one dollar into your savings account, it earns interest for you. And the interest you earned will generate even more interest. So on and so forth, your money grows faster and faster. This is especially true when you invest it in diversified portfolios. By delaying gratification, you give your money space to grow and it will make you richer. Conversely, when you spend that dollar instead of investing it, you are missing out on all its future potential. 

**Three ways to get better at delaying gratification:** 

**Tip No.1** \- Put yourself at the optimal state. Research shows that healthy eating, sufficient sleep, and exercise can improve your ability to delay gratification. All these things can put more fuel in your willpower tank. 

**Tip No.2** \- Focus on your goals. Reminding yourself of the goals you are saving for is a great way to improve your willpower. By visualizing achieving your goals, you will find it easier to stick to saving. 

**Tip No.3** \- Surround yourself with people with willpower – as social animals, we are heavily affected by others around us. If you hang out with people with poor self-control, you are setting a low bar for yourself. On the other hand, if you surround yourself with people who are also working towards bigger goals, you will find it easier to say no to temptations.",LPT - Delayed Gratification and Money Success

LifeProTips,"The Pomodoro Technique has been popular since the early 1990's, it's a simple technique use to help concentrate and work efficiently, cut down on distractions and prioritize tasks.

Set a timer for 25 minutes, that's 1 pomodoro. Work consistently through the 25 minutes, after your timer goes off take a short break for 5 minutes, after 4 pomodoros, take a longer break 15-30 minutes. There are some basic rules to follow:

- Pomodoro's are not divisible, there is no half, quarter, or I'll finish it later. Once you start, you cannot stop. If you do have to stop, the pomodoro is void.
 - If you finish a task, and you still have time left, take the extra time to review your work, tidy your desk, prepare for the next task, work on something small, like responding to that email from 10 minutes ago etc. Don't stop working!!!

- Your mind will start to race, kids, roommates, spouses, calls, emails and texts will try to distract you. Tell them to wait, or write a quick note to handle something later, call someone back etc. then get back to the task at hand.
 - People will start to recognize your time is valuable, and will know that you will get back to them, they'll start respecting your time. You will also learn to concentrate better and better prioritize tasks, you'll do less wandering working multiple things at once.

- Once you get good at it, start estimating work in terms of pomodoros (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break)
 - You'll then be able to analyze effort, maybe you're spending too much time researching a paper, not enough writing. Change the break down to 1 pomodoros for research, 2 for writing and 1 for review, take a long break.

There are plenty of pomodoro timers, apps, todo lists and browser extensions, or you can use it the way it started with a kitchen timer.

LifeProTips,"   Now, more than ever, is the time to support small businesses if you're able to. In the US alone, there are millions of small businesses with fewer than 100 employees, hundreds of thousands with no employees just immediate family covering all duties, or only the owner handling everything. Locally-owned restaurants are deeply feeling the effects of the pandemic and associated fears, especially now that thousands are under forced closure, countless specialty stores and servicepeople are seeing a massive drop in customers, and often it's their sole source of income. While some people stocked up on hand soap and paper products, they weren't hiring a contractor or buying tourist souvenirs. 

The major retailers won't go under. Caution of close proximity, or worse, misplaced damaging fears based on nationality, far fewer people are going to restaurants or using delivery services. Aside from local proprietors such as bakeries and garden nurseries, there are thousands of small manufacturers and retailers with online stores, offering everything from handcrafted soaps and unique artisan perfumes, to customised kitchenware or car accessories, plus artists who often rely on commissions. It's a good boost to local economies, and more importantly, the well-being of your neighbours.",LPT: Support small businesses if you're able; it's vital right now to help keep them afloat.

LifeProTips,"I am fortunate enough to get to work from home for the next few weeks and a have bit of PTO accrued that I was going to use later this year.  A letter was sent out from HR that warehouse employees affected by the shelter-in-place rules are not to come in to work, in accordance with the county mandates (SF Bay Area).  They're working on how to compensate the employees, however, in the meantime I offered up half of my PTO to employees that won't be able to make rent or feed their kids because of this situation.
  
I'm encouraging my peers to do the same and, if you're in a position to, I encourage you to do so as well.  I've been in rough financial spots before and it meant the world to me when people made even the smallest gesture to help out.  Hopefully by helping one another we can grow closer as a community and country once this is all said and done.
