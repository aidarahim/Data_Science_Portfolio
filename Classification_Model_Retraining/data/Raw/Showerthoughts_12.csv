Showerthoughts,"I had this thought that an innumerable human beings have the capability to be great but only a few do because of the random selection we have at birth and the people we come into contact with in life.

For example, I was listening to a Richard Feynman lecture when I had this thought "" I wish I had a physics teacher as him, maybe I'd have been doing my PhD in Physics"" . Now, this is not a self bragging post. But I think I'm pretty smart, by various comparisons and metrics I've come across life. I could have gone into a lot of fields and maybe contributed something new. I belive many others would be the same. I will for sure try do something worthwile in my current role.

But the question remains,is it that a lot of people in our history or present could have been someone else, lest the randomness at birth?","Everyone could be special, lest the randomness at birth"
